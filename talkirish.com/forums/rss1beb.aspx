You can find it on Spotify&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I met this kid in Chicago who claimed to be a former banjo player, and he asked me to listen to his album. At first I was skeptical, because it seemed pretty bogus. Turns out, not only is the album pretty good, but it has everything to do with Ireland. Underglow on a Pontoon is about a day spent in Ireland, and the whole album seems heavily inspired by the town of Slane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solid 7/10 overall, I wouldn&amp;#39;t pay for it but luckily enough it was free. Check it out&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="clear:both;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
