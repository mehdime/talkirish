&lt;p&gt;As discussed, the sentence order typically follows a Verb-Subject-Object syntax, with a couple of notable exceptions.&amp;nbsp; Irish has another sentence structure that revolves around a &amp;quot;copula&amp;quot;, which is an identification &amp;quot;verb&amp;quot; (although some regard it more as a linguistic equal sign).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Irish makes extensive use of prepositional pronouns.&amp;nbsp; These are not simple combinations of prepositions and pronouns, but are used in many ways to convey a meaning that the direct translation would not carry in English.&amp;nbsp; For example, to say &amp;quot;I have a book&amp;quot; would be &amp;quot;T&amp;aacute; leabhar agam.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp; Literally translated it says &amp;quot;A book is at me.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp; The preposition&lt;i&gt; ag&lt;/i&gt; (meaning&lt;i&gt; at&lt;/i&gt;) is used to convey the idea of possession or having something.&amp;nbsp; There is no Irish verb &amp;quot;to have&amp;quot;.&amp;nbsp; There are many other examples of prepositional pronoun constructs that carry a verbal meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Irish is a Celtic language in what is known as the goidelic language group, which consists of Irish, Scottish Gaelic, and Manx.&amp;nbsp; Welsh and Cornish are also related, but in a different linguistic group.&amp;nbsp; Word constructs in these languages are by and large unfamiliar to English speakers, so there is very little ability to look at a word and intuitively deduce what it might mean, they way an English speaker might be able to do when learning German, or to a lesser degree with Spanish or some of the Romance languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The numbering system is somewhat more complicated in Irish than in English; it takes some practice and study to get used to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Irish language uses mutations to a very great extent, and there are several different mutation types, but they primarily consist of &amp;quot;lenition&amp;quot;, which is a softening of an initial consonant, &amp;quot;eclipsis&amp;quot; which is the replacement of an initial consonant, and &amp;quot;vowel eclipsis&amp;quot; (my term for placing a consonant in front of an initial vowel).&amp;nbsp; All these mutations convey a wide variety of linguistic information, such as gender, verb tense, or objective classification (direct vs. indirect), and many others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those are my observations on some of the more significant details of the Irish language.&amp;nbsp; There are probably many more, and may be considered by some as needing to be included in a list like this, but I think this gives you a good start on the differences.&amp;nbsp; It may seem daunting, but with dedication and effort, it can be learned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goodl luck!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What materials are you using to learn?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="clear:both;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description></item><item><title>Can anyone help?</title><link>http://talkirish.com/forums/thread/17670.aspx</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 May 2019 23:13:18 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">0644754f-ff87-49dd-b5e3-0e104f790f4a:17670</guid><dc:creator>Sir Chess</dc:creator><slash:comments>0</slash:comments><comments>http://talkirish.com/forums/thread/17670.aspx</comments><wfw:commentRss>http://talkirish.com/forums/commentrss.aspx?SectionID=7&amp;PostID=17670</wfw:commentRss><description>&lt;p&gt;Hello. I&amp;#39;m trying to get a more detailed understanding of the structure of this amazing language. I&amp;#39;ve only 3 months studying it on My own, and must say, it&amp;#39;s just a bit confusing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="clear:both;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
