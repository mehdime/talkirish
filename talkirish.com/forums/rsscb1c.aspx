I must have done something wrong! I&amp;#39;m not much good with IT. The phrase &amp;#39;coinnigh an d&amp;eacute;&amp;#39; means, as you say, &amp;#39;keep the breath (of life)&amp;#39;. If a fire is nearly dying but there is still a glow of red ashes in it, you would say &amp;#39;T&amp;aacute; an d&amp;eacute; go f&amp;oacute;ill ann&amp;#39;, it&amp;#39;s still alive, the breath of life is still in it&amp;#39;. The same with people or animals. As for the other, I think it has been got at by Autocorrect. It is &amp;#39;tarraing an&amp;aacute;il&amp;#39;, draw breath. Both of these are Irish, though I think the Scottish Gaelic would be similar. I hope that you manage to overcome your problems with stress and pain, and I&amp;#39;m sure everyone else here would join me in wishing you all the best in the future.

D&amp;eacute; is a kind of literary term. If a fire or a person dies, we say the the d&amp;eacute; goes out of them. The other one seems to have been got at by Microsoft autocorrect, which is a curse for anyone working in more than one language. It&amp;#39;s SO badly designed! The proper version would be tarraing an&amp;aacute;il, which literally means breathe or &amp;#39;draw a breath&amp;#39;. Both of these are Irish rather than Scots Gaelic, though I imagine the Scots version is similar. I wish you all best with your health problems this year.

The other is terrain an&amp;aacute;il which is supposed to be draw a breath, or so I&amp;#39;ve been told.

&lt;p&gt;Ba ch&amp;oacute;ir dom means I should have. Leagan cainte literaly means a laying out of speech, so it&amp;#39;s a turn of phrase, N&amp;iacute;os simpl&amp;iacute; is simpler. And a roghn&amp;uacute; is just to choose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the whole thing together is I should have a simpler turn of phrase to choose, or to put it another way, I should have chosen a simpler turn of phrase. That structure is confusing because it isn&amp;#39;t like the English in terms of word order. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, now I&amp;#39;m having a little trouble putting it all together....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something like, &amp;quot;The turn of phrase was proper for me, not simply a choice.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp; Is that at all close?&amp;nbsp; I always get confused by &amp;quot;Ba&amp;quot; and have to remember, from expressions like &amp;quot;Ba maith liom&amp;quot;, that it&amp;#39;s the past tense form of the copula, so I then have to remember to reverse the subject and object to make sense of the construct when translating....&amp;nbsp; At least, in this case, I did.&amp;nbsp; I hope I got close to the sense of it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dale D&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PS&amp;nbsp; I&amp;#39;m quite enjoying this!&amp;nbsp; When you throw in those little things at the end of a post, they&amp;#39;re always quite instructive to me.&amp;nbsp; For example, in this one, I looked up &lt;i&gt;leagan&lt;/i&gt; in my Irish/English dictionary, and it gave the definition as &amp;quot;knocking down, demolition; fall; lowering; laying, setting; imutation; version&amp;quot; but it followed these definitions with several usage examples, and one of them was &lt;i&gt;leagan cainte&lt;/i&gt; which it defined as &amp;quot;turn of speech&amp;quot;.&amp;nbsp; I would have never gotten that from the definitions given!&amp;nbsp; Well, maybe if I really stretched it, but I would have been quite uncertain of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It does appear that &lt;i&gt;leagan&lt;/i&gt; &amp;quot;knocking down, demolition&amp;quot; as a noun is related to &lt;i&gt;leag&lt;/i&gt; &amp;quot;knock down&amp;quot; as a verb, which I remember from the proverb I translated, with your assistance some time back:&amp;nbsp; &lt;i&gt;Leagaidh buill&amp;iacute; beaga dair m&amp;oacute;ir.&amp;nbsp; &amp;quot;Little strokes fell great oaks.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/i&gt;I may have used the future tense on that, but I&amp;#39;m not sure it matters, as it may be true either way.&amp;nbsp; Probably the imperative form is more correct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="clear:both;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description></item><item><title>Re: Translation</title><link>http://talkirish.com/forums/thread/11403.aspx</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jun 2014 18:45:19 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">0644754f-ff87-49dd-b5e3-0e104f790f4a:11403</guid><dc:creator>Dale D</dc:creator><slash:comments>0</slash:comments><comments>http://talkirish.com/forums/thread/11403.aspx</comments><wfw:commentRss>http://talkirish.com/forums/commentrss.aspx?SectionID=7&amp;PostID=11403</wfw:commentRss><description>&lt;p&gt;Haigh, trinantron.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sure se&amp;aacute;n&amp;oacute; will answer in due course, but your query is interesting on several levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Irish language constructs on the subject of love are quite different from English, and I fear the construct you have asked about is an English one, not an Irish one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic format for telling someone you love them is to say, &amp;quot;I have love in my heart for you&amp;quot; -- &lt;i&gt;T&amp;aacute; gr&amp;aacute; agam duitse&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;nbsp; This uses the Irish idiom &amp;quot;Love is at me&amp;quot; which is translated &amp;quot;I have love&amp;quot;.&amp;nbsp; The final word, &lt;i&gt;duitse&lt;/i&gt;, is the emphatic form of the prepositional pronoun &lt;i&gt;duit&lt;/i&gt; &amp;quot;to you&amp;quot;.&amp;nbsp; the Irish word for &amp;quot;heart&amp;quot; &lt;i&gt;cro&amp;iacute;&lt;/i&gt; does not appear in the sentence at all, but is implied through the emphatic suffix on &lt;i&gt;duit&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The expression &amp;quot;my love for you&amp;quot; is not an independent phrase in English, so an attempt to translate it into Irish may depend very much on how it is applied in a complete sentence.&amp;nbsp; You could say &amp;quot;mo ghr&amp;aacute; duit&amp;quot; but I haven&amp;#39;t seen such a construct in my reading.&amp;nbsp; I think you may be hard-pressed to get a satisfactory response to this query without some context.&amp;nbsp; Perhaps &lt;i&gt;Is &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;i&gt;duit&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;mo &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;ghr&amp;aacute;&lt;/i&gt; could work, but that might be translated &amp;quot;You are my love&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;My love is for you&amp;quot;.&amp;nbsp; A similar idea, but not exactly definitive....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Irish seems to prefer to express &amp;quot;love&amp;quot; as a noun rather than a verb.&amp;nbsp; The phrase &amp;quot;I love you&amp;quot; would be unusual in Irish because &amp;quot;love&amp;quot; seldom appears as a verb.&amp;nbsp; I have found a couple of instances of it, in biblical passages, Romans 13:9 being one, and Matthew 22:37, 39 also, each for a similar use.&amp;nbsp; For me, that simply says that trying to employ the Irish word &lt;i&gt;gr&amp;aacute; &lt;/i&gt;&amp;quot;love&amp;quot; in similar ways as we employ &amp;quot;love&amp;quot; in English could lead to some issues.&amp;nbsp; Your example may or may not be one of them, but my sense is that this would not be a typical construct &lt;i&gt;as Gaeilge&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sl&amp;aacute;n!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just a bit of history first...I wanted to see how much of this I could figure out before resorting to my dictionaries or Bunt&amp;uacute;s Cainte books.&amp;nbsp; So my rough translation is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isn&amp;#39;t it good that you are coming along with the language now?&amp;nbsp; (I used the questionmark even though you didn&amp;#39;t....)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After looking up a couple of words and looking at the construct again, I would revise my translation slightly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isn&amp;#39;t it good that you have the language coming along now?&amp;nbsp; (And I agree that the exclaimation point may be appropriate as well, even though the construct is interrogative.&amp;nbsp; ;o}&amp;nbsp; )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Literally:&amp;nbsp; Isn&amp;#39;t it good that you are at the language coming inside you now?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It looks to me like the &amp;quot;to have&amp;quot; lidiom in play, so I&amp;#39;m sure it&amp;#39;s something like the second translation above, but again, I am open to correctiions!&amp;nbsp; And I would like to know how you would express it in English, in case I&amp;#39;m off in one direction or the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

Well done! Coinnigh ort means Keep at it or keep it up, and is fi&amp;uacute; an braon allais &amp;eacute; literally means it&amp;#39;s worth the drop of sweat, it&amp;#39;s something that&amp;#39;s worth struggling to achieve. Another common expression these days is &amp;quot;coinnigh beo &amp;eacute;&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;coinnigh lasta &amp;eacute;&amp;quot;, which is really a translation of the colloquial English-Irish (or maybe it came from Irish and was translated into English) phrase keep it lit or keep her lit, which is&amp;nbsp;difficult to explain&amp;nbsp;exactly&amp;nbsp;but keep on keeping on is pretty much the same! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nach go maith at&amp;aacute; t&amp;uacute; ag teacht isteach ar an teanga anois!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may very well be correct about the plurality needing to match the noun rather than referring to the number of persons addressed; I think it&amp;#39;s the same in Spanish, but that hadn&amp;#39;t occurred to me as I was writing this.&amp;nbsp; I guess we&amp;#39;d have to consult with the poet to determine which way he meant it!&amp;nbsp; But we can leave it with &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; and hope it&amp;#39;s correct....&amp;nbsp; ;o}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was working on translating the line at the end of your post...let&amp;#39;s see how I did......&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a little unsure of the first part, &lt;i&gt;Coinnigh ort&lt;/i&gt;; &amp;quot;Coinnigh&amp;quot; means to maintain or preserve or keep, so I&amp;#39;m thinking &amp;quot;Coinnigh ort&amp;quot; would mean something like, &amp;quot;Keep on keepin&amp;#39; on&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;stay with it&amp;quot;, or something of that ilk, and &lt;i&gt;is fi&amp;uacute; an braon allais &amp;eacute;&lt;/i&gt; I think means, &amp;quot;a little sweat is worth it.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp; In English we would say (poetically) &amp;quot;No pain no gain&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cathy, I apologize if I spoiled an opportunity to translate that on your own...but then again, I may be off base here as well!&amp;nbsp; At least, it&amp;#39;s happened before.....&lt;/p&gt;

Tuoi is a plural form, but the fact is that plurality in words like this in languages like French&amp;nbsp;(and I think Italian)&amp;nbsp;refers to the thing(s) owned and not to the owner and I suspect that this is the case here - that the tu is singular but that the tuoi form is used because the things owned are multiple. Hope that makes sense - it&amp;#39;s a bit complicated. Anyway, I think that it should be do here rather than bhur. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sentence as a whole is ambiguous in English and also in Irish if you translate it as &amp;quot;Tiocfaidh an b&amp;aacute;s agus beidh do sh&amp;uacute;ile aige.&amp;quot; Does it mean that death will come and pluck the eyes out of your head, or does it mean that death will come and will see the world as you do or resemble you in some way, or is the poet talking to a lover and saying that when death comes the eyes of death will resemble the lover&amp;#39;s eyes? I don&amp;#39;t know. I suppose it&amp;#39;s poetry and ambiguity goes with the territory!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Cathy, well done for wanting to bring your Irish back! There are so many people who are negative about the language these days, people who say that it is an expensive irrelevance, a dinosaur, a millstone around our necks blah, blah, blah. It&amp;#39;s easy to forget that a great many Irish people still love and value the language, and those people pay taxes, vote and&amp;nbsp;have rights too! Coinnigh ort, is fi&amp;uacute; an braon allais &amp;eacute;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
