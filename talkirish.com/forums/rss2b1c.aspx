Hearing it as much as possible is going to help and improve your pronunciation and recognition, not debilitate your efforts. But it seems you clearly have a plan as to where you want to go with your studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="clear:both;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description></item><item><title>Re: Reading Irish</title><link>http://talkirish.com/forums/thread/7999.aspx</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jan 2013 12:44:59 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">0644754f-ff87-49dd-b5e3-0e104f790f4a:7999</guid><dc:creator>celticlord88</dc:creator><slash:comments>0</slash:comments><comments>http://talkirish.com/forums/thread/7999.aspx</comments><wfw:commentRss>http://talkirish.com/forums/commentrss.aspx?SectionID=7&amp;PostID=7999</wfw:commentRss><description>&lt;p&gt;Yes, I&amp;#39;ve been studying for about a week, but I&amp;#39;ve been drilling for hours on end every day. In fact, compared to other languages I&amp;#39;ve studied, this has shown the most progress. I&amp;#39;m confident with about 95% of pronounciation. It&amp;#39;s just the diphthongs and triphthongs that I am still drilling. I&amp;#39;m making progress with them. The reason I&amp;#39;m trying to become confident with pronounciation is because I don&amp;#39;t want to be completely reliant on audio samples. I use them to check and correct myself. I&amp;#39;ve been using Bitesize Irish which I really like because they have simple sentences for their vocabulary and that helps me a lot with grammar. I&amp;#39;m trying to use free materials right now (which there are a lot of) and later on, I might invest in something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I&amp;#39;ve neglected to do though is write the words down by hand. Knowing how to spell a word helps a lot with pronounciation. I&amp;#39;ll try to stay small for now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="clear:both;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description></item><item><title>Re: Reading Irish</title><link>http://talkirish.com/forums/thread/7997.aspx</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jan 2013 09:49:43 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">0644754f-ff87-49dd-b5e3-0e104f790f4a:7997</guid><dc:creator>Princess L</dc:creator><slash:comments>0</slash:comments><comments>http://talkirish.com/forums/thread/7997.aspx</comments><wfw:commentRss>http://talkirish.com/forums/commentrss.aspx?SectionID=7&amp;PostID=7997</wfw:commentRss><description>&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think you are jumping the gun a bit. I read one of your previous posts and I see that you&amp;#39;ve only been studying for a week, correct? I think by trying to read before you&amp;#39;ve barely begun is not going to go well as far as progress is concerned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you explored much of this site yet? You should really play the games and get the hang of seeing the word, hearing the word, and seeing a picture of the word&amp;#39;s representation. &amp;nbsp;And not just for a few minutes; a few minutes&lt;i&gt; every day&lt;/i&gt; until you can recognize the object in every day life and know exactly what it is and how to spell it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline;"&gt;really&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; have to start small; in order to get the hang of dipthongs and tripthongs, or anything else, you have to start small, simple, and consistent. This is &lt;b&gt;so&lt;/b&gt; important. You will progress way faster this way, trust me. Play the word flash games for a few minutes every day -- it will help tremendously. Test yourself with the flash quizzes afterwards and take note of your results and improvement. Check out the Dictionary and Daily Irish words with their example sentences. Listen to them as often as you need to -- download them if you like. Hearing the words spoken, seeing what they mean, and seeing how they are spelled will help with your reading, writing and listening. Repeat the words out loud after you hear them to the best of your ability and don&amp;#39;t despair if you can&amp;#39;t make such a sound at first. You will read &lt;i&gt;tons&lt;/i&gt; of posts on here saying the same thing to other newcomers, but that&amp;#39;s because this advice &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;works&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t think you should focus on conversation so early on either. Thinking in a different language definitely takes effort, and I believe a lot more practice is needed before anyone can seriously feel comfortable with that.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, do lots of internet research about the Irish language in your area. It&amp;#39;s easy to fall into the trap of assuming that there couldn&amp;#39;t possibly be any Irish language lessons or school, or even Irish speakers where you live. I fell into that trap myself, but then I learned of an Irish language school that&amp;#39;s been in my very county for longer than I&amp;#39;ve been alive. I learned that there are many who attend that school who are fluent in Irish and have never even been to Ireland. I can&amp;#39;t attend right now because of the scheduling, but I know it&amp;#39;s always there for when timing is better for me. The best part is that tuition is completely free! So do your research; you may be pleasantly surprised as to what you&amp;#39;ll find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for printed material, I recommend &lt;i&gt;Learning Irish&lt;/i&gt; by M&amp;iacute;ch&amp;eacute;al &amp;Oacute; Siadhall. It&amp;#39;s a book and CD set in Cois Fharrige dialect (different than Talk Irish material). The lessons are laid out very short -- they don&amp;#39;t shove too much down your throat, rather they give you little bits to take in at a time. &lt;br /&gt;The first CD covers all the sounds that form Irish: dipthongs, tripthongs, slender vowels and consonants, broad vowels and consonants, lenition, eclipsis, etc. It accompanies the book, so you can read the example as you listen to it pronounced (and don&amp;#39;t forget to repeat after them!). Don&amp;#39;t go through that section once and never again; go back to it once in a while, every other lesson or so.&lt;br /&gt;Then the next CDs cover the vocabulary words and the written texts printed in the book. &amp;nbsp;One downside is that the vocabulary and texts are recited fast (with only pauses for long sentences) at normal speed with no other for clarification which can be disheartening at first. Just remain calm and listen to it as you follow along with the written text in front of you -- you&amp;#39;ll soon be able to follow along with them. The book has a few errors in it, but they&amp;#39;re minor and infrequent. The thing I hate about the book is its construction; it started falling apart after 4 months of use. It&amp;#39;s not that I didn&amp;#39;t take proper care of it, it&amp;#39;s that I used it a LOT. It&amp;#39;s such an excellent resource so I was constantly opening it up and it was not constructed well enough to hold up to constant use (which is stupid since it&amp;#39;s a language book which &lt;i&gt;needs &lt;/i&gt;to be referenced to).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Learning Irish&lt;/i&gt; is for anyone on any level, but I started using it after a year and three months of nothing but Talk Irish material (not &lt;i&gt;Buntus Cainte&lt;/i&gt;). When I got the &lt;i&gt;Learning Irish&lt;/i&gt; book, I was able to zoom through Lesson 2 through 6 with ease, especially reading through the texts, because most of the material I knew from Talk Irish, and the new material they provided was not difficult to grasp onto right away. =)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The problem I&amp;#39;m having though is that I don&amp;#39;t know if I am pronouncing the words correctly and I don&amp;#39;t know if I am using too many syllables. Any advice? If possible, could anyone get on skype and listen to me read Irish and offer corrections? At least until I get the hang of it. I&amp;#39;m reading in order to get the hang of the diphthongs and triphthongs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="clear:both;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
