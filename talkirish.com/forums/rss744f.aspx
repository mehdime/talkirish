&lt;p&gt;Here are some examples of nouns with adjectives in the plural:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;tithe m&amp;oacute;ra&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;cait bheaga&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;l&amp;aacute;na&amp;iacute; caola&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;fir chiallmhara&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;deochanna searbha&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;buill&amp;iacute; troma&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;laethanta fada&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;laethanta gearra&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope these help. Any other questions! As I say, I&amp;#39;m much more available now so I&amp;#39;ll do my best to give a proper, full answer. All the best, Se&amp;aacute;no.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if I take the buille and make it buill&amp;iacute; for plural, and hence beaga to make them agree, thenit would make sense for dair to be plural as well&amp;nbsp; Is there a plural for m&amp;oacute;r?&amp;nbsp; (Or mh&amp;oacute;r?)&amp;nbsp; Does it get an &amp;quot;a&amp;quot; added as well?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Latest version:&amp;nbsp; Leagfaidh buill&amp;iacute; beaga dair&amp;iacute; mh&amp;oacute;r.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dale D&lt;/p&gt;

I have been a bit lazy of late. I was very busy there before Christmas and I now have a bit more time, so I have decided to start contributing to TalkIrish more often and at greater length. There are a few points to clarify here. First, the beaga. The other person who contributed probably thought that buille is a plural, in which case the adjective would have to agree. But in fact, buille is singular, so it&amp;#39;s just beag. If you made it plural &amp;quot;buill&amp;iacute; beaga&amp;quot; you would have to make the adjective plural. As for where you put the adjective in the phrase &amp;quot;big oak tree&amp;quot; people get very exercised about these matters and some people will tell you flatly that you should put the adjective between the two nouns - thus siopa m&amp;oacute;r leabhar (a big book shop) instead of siopa leabhar m&amp;oacute;r (whch they claim means a shop of big books). In reality, there is a tendency for phrases like siopa leabhar to be treated like individual words and so the adjective usually comes after, whatever the usage might have been a hundred years ago. Darach is the genitive of dair. While I would say dara, I&amp;#39;ve just remembered that officially it&amp;#39;s spelled darach (we tend not to pronounce a ch at the end of a word in Ulster) so I misled you there! Sorry about that! Yes, people just pick s&amp;eacute;imhi&amp;uacute; and ur&amp;uacute; up, though unfortunately some people now are very sloppy about these points of grammar. Any other questions, let me know! Beir bua! Se&amp;aacute;no&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="clear:both;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description></item><item><title>Re: My Own Seanfhocail...</title><link>http://talkirish.com/forums/thread/8036.aspx</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Jan 2013 17:05:43 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">0644754f-ff87-49dd-b5e3-0e104f790f4a:8036</guid><dc:creator>Dale D</dc:creator><slash:comments>0</slash:comments><comments>http://talkirish.com/forums/thread/8036.aspx</comments><wfw:commentRss>http://talkirish.com/forums/commentrss.aspx?SectionID=41&amp;PostID=8036</wfw:commentRss><description>&lt;p&gt;Thanks, Se&amp;aacute;n!&amp;nbsp; I haven&amp;#39;t heard from you for a while...but then, I experienced a period of &amp;quot;black-out&amp;quot; where I couldn&amp;#39;t seem to post anywhere on the Talk Irish site.&amp;nbsp; Glad that seems to have been fixed!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess your reply coaxes a few more questions out of me!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first reply suggested using &amp;quot;beaga&amp;quot; instead of just &amp;quot;beag&amp;quot;, but you didn&amp;#39;t include that.&amp;nbsp; Any reason?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am used to Spanish (somewhat) where adjectives and adverbs tend to follow the word they are modifying, and while that doesn&amp;#39;t necessarily appear to be a hard and fast rule in Irish, it seems fairly predominant, with the exceptions of &amp;quot;very&amp;quot; (an-) which is a hyphenated prefix as opposed to a stand alone word, and probably a few others I&amp;#39;m not aware of.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; So I would have thought it more or less a rule that &amp;quot;m&amp;oacute;r&amp;quot; (or mh&amp;oacute;r) would follow dair or dara.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Crann becomes the direct object when used in the expression, I assume then that &amp;quot;dara&amp;quot; is the form of &amp;quot;dair&amp;quot; needed to be used as an adjective.&amp;nbsp; Is that actually the genetive form, or is it an adjectival form?&amp;nbsp; Or are they the same thing, in essence?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorry for so many questions.&amp;nbsp; I find understanding the rules for using the cases of nouns and the rules for lenition and eclipsis all very confusing.&amp;nbsp; I may hae mentioned this before, but my first text on the Irish language was a &amp;quot;Teach Yourself&amp;quot; series book &amp;quot;Teach Yourself Irish&amp;quot;, by Miles Dillon and Donnchadh &amp;oacute; Cr&amp;oacute;in&amp;iacute;n, which I purchased in Cork in 1974.&amp;nbsp; I learned a lot from reading it, although probably not as much as I should have, and I got sidetracked from it when a friend exclaimed to me, &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;ll never learn Irish readin&amp;#39; that!&amp;quot; and gave me her copies of Buntus Cainte.&amp;nbsp; Anyway, in &amp;quot;Teach Yourself Irish&amp;quot;, the authors had quite a list of rules for when either lenition (which they referred to as &amp;quot;aspiration&amp;quot;) or eclipsis should be applied.&amp;nbsp; For us died-in-the-wool English speakers, it must be pretty daunting to make sense of it.&amp;nbsp; I may have to go back and do as they suggested, and memorize each rule.&amp;nbsp; I&amp;#39;m wondering if the rules are taught that formally in ordinary Irish language instruction in schools?&amp;nbsp; It also seems like they need to be intuitively adopted.&amp;nbsp; In English, we often hear a mother correct a child for incorrect grammar, when the child says, &amp;quot;I are going to school now&amp;quot;, and the mother replies &amp;quot;I &lt;em&gt;am&lt;/em&gt; going to school now!&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp; I am envisioning something where the rules for lenition and eclipsis are picked up in a similar fashion?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorry to get so long-winded there, but it&amp;#39;s a subject that&amp;#39;s both frustrating and fascinating at the same time.&amp;nbsp; It&amp;#39;s hard to get the full picture of what those changes do or what information they convey.&amp;nbsp; Irish is the only language I&amp;#39;ve experienced where a poem can be constructed with the same word at the end of two different lines, but in two different cases so that it forms a legitimate rime!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks again for all your help, seano!&amp;nbsp; You&amp;#39;ve been a most consistent responder, and I appreciate it!&lt;/p&gt;

Yes, it would be dair mh&amp;oacute;r, although in general people usually say &amp;quot;crann dara&amp;quot;.

&lt;p&gt;I am trying to translate the expression &amp;quot;Little strokes fell great oaks&amp;quot; as I thought it would be an interesting exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I started with the verb &amp;quot;leag&amp;quot; -- &amp;quot;fell, cut down&amp;quot; -- and determined that the nature of the expression includes an implied future tense, i.e., &amp;quot;Little strokes &lt;em&gt;will &lt;/em&gt;fell great oaks.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp; Consequently, I began with &amp;quot;leagfaidh&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A stroke or a chop is &amp;quot;buille&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;small&amp;quot; is &amp;quot;beag&amp;quot;, so &amp;quot;Leagfaidh buille beag...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...and &amp;quot;oak&amp;quot; is &amp;quot;dair&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;m&amp;oacute;r&amp;quot; is &amp;quot;big&amp;quot; (or &amp;quot;great&amp;quot; in size) so I proceeded with &amp;quot;dair m&amp;oacute;r&amp;quot; at the end:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Leagfaidh buille beag dair m&amp;oacute;r.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now for the hard part, meaning the part I still don&amp;#39;t fully understand.&amp;nbsp; Lenition and eclipsis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have gathered in doing some reading that noun cases seem to change when treated as subject or object.&amp;nbsp; So is the &amp;quot;genetive&amp;quot; case the &amp;quot;objective&amp;quot; mode?&amp;nbsp; And what would that mean in the present instance?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And does the adverb following the noun change as well?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So instead of &amp;quot;dair m&amp;oacute;r&amp;quot;. would it be &amp;quot;dhair mh&amp;oacute;r&amp;quot;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or am I &lt;em&gt;completely&lt;/em&gt; off base?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, the English expression uses plurals (strokes, oaks) so if someone can help me on the pluralization, that would be great as well....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for the help!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dale&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="clear:both;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
