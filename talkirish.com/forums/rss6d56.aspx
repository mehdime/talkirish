I have worked in translations for over 20 years and was now asked to help find translators from English to Irish for a set of texts dealing with drug rehabilitation. It is a rather large body of texts which needs to be translated in the next few weeks. Most of the text is very simply worded and easy to understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both professional and volunteer translators are welcome. If you want to participate or know anyone who can, please let me know! &lt;img src="http://talkirish.com/emoticons/emotion-1.gif" alt="Smile" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will be very cool to make drug rehabilitation materials translated into Irish (among other languages) so they are accessible to anybody who might need this! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="clear:both;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
