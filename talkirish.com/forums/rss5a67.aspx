The figure of Fionn became a supernatural giant in popular folklore and almost any kind of geographical feature was attributed to him. Seathr&amp;uacute;n C&amp;eacute;itinn says that the common people called dolmens Leapacha na F&amp;eacute;inne (Fianna Beds) while people of his class called them Alt&amp;oacute;ir&amp;iacute; na nDraoithe (Druid Altars). The most famous example of this is the Giant&amp;#39;s Causeway. In Irish tradition, this is ascribed to the Fomh&amp;oacute;raigh or Fomorians, a mysterious group of sea-pirates and it&amp;#39;s Irish name is Cloch&amp;aacute;n na bhFomh&amp;oacute;rach, the Fomorians&amp;#39; Causeway. However, everybody now thinks that the legend is that it was built by Fionn Mac Cumhaill, which is probably what the common folk believed. In other places in England and Scotland, natural features tend to be named after King Arthur or Robin Hood in the same way. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="clear:both;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description></item><item><title>Re: Need background information on Ireland (Culture/History/Folklore) for a Manga</title><link>http://talkirish.com/forums/thread/9520.aspx</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Sep 2013 16:43:38 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">0644754f-ff87-49dd-b5e3-0e104f790f4a:9520</guid><dc:creator>Dale D</dc:creator><slash:comments>0</slash:comments><comments>http://talkirish.com/forums/thread/9520.aspx</comments><wfw:commentRss>http://talkirish.com/forums/commentrss.aspx?SectionID=7&amp;PostID=9520</wfw:commentRss><description>&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know of a certainty of how people in Ireland view some of the ancient myths and legends, but I remember hearing a myth that Loch Neigh NW of Belfast was created when Fionn mac Cumhail grabbed a clod of dirt to throw at a fleeing giant, and where the clod landed in the Irish sea became the Isle of Man.&amp;nbsp; Given the size of these two features, it would be the feat of no ordinary person.&amp;nbsp; So perhaps incorporating some of the legendary characters of the Fenian cycle would be an interesting addition.&amp;nbsp; Fionn was also said to have the power to heal a person with water poured from his hands.&amp;nbsp; (It may have been from a particular stream, too, but I&amp;#39;m sure the info is out there somewhere....)&amp;nbsp; Many of the other members of the Fiana F&amp;aacute;il were powerful warriors, and had abilities that far exceeded what one would expect from a &amp;quot;mere mortal&amp;quot;; another example is Diarmaid &amp;Oacute; Duibhne, from the story &amp;quot;Tora&amp;iacute;ocht Dhiarmada agus Ghrainne&amp;quot;, who performs a number of amazing feats.&amp;nbsp; A giant is also featured in the story, so giants may be another mythological &amp;quot;creature&amp;quot; to consider, as they are found in many cultures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My two pence worth....&lt;/p&gt;

I think it&amp;#39;s a great idea. I always love seeing Irish in unexpected places - names of Racehorses etc. As Maxtro says, there are lots of books and other sources out there and some of the Irish myths are very interesting and very different. As for Sky King, that&amp;#39;ll be R&amp;iacute; na Sp&amp;eacute;ire. Sp&amp;eacute;ir-R&amp;iacute; is OK (don&amp;#39;t forget the hyphen)&amp;nbsp;but it just sounds a bit flat to me. R&amp;iacute; na Sp&amp;eacute;ire has a certain ring to it! Good luck with your manga and if we can help in any way with information, we&amp;#39;re here!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore I`d like you to share anything with me that could be of use to me in my enterprise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and the title is already decided: I`ll call it Sky King, but the thing is I want it to be in irish so all I could come up with while researching the iinternet for a translation was &lt;span id="result_box" class="short_text"&gt;&lt;span class="hps"&gt;sp&amp;eacute;ir&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="hps"&gt;r&amp;iacute;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks in advance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="clear:both;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
