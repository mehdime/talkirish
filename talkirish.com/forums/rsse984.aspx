The word ding is common enough in Irish English and is also common in Irish in the sense of a dent. I note that most dictionaries suggest that it is an English dialect word borrowed into Irish but I am not entirely sure about this. It would certainly be worth someone with a knowledge of English etymology looking at the evidence again, as the primary meaning in English seems to be a strike or a blow rather than a dent, which is the main meaning in Irish and in American English. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the best, Seano.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="clear:both;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description></item><item><title>Re: Irish words in English</title><link>http://talkirish.com/forums/thread/8445.aspx</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Jul 2013 18:43:02 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">0644754f-ff87-49dd-b5e3-0e104f790f4a:8445</guid><dc:creator>Dale D</dc:creator><slash:comments>0</slash:comments><comments>http://talkirish.com/forums/thread/8445.aspx</comments><wfw:commentRss>http://talkirish.com/forums/commentrss.aspx?SectionID=7&amp;PostID=8445</wfw:commentRss><description>&lt;p&gt;Hi, seano.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was going through some things and looking up some words in the dictionary, and one really stuck out at me as pertains to this topic, so I went back to find the thread and revive it....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was curious about a few things, and wanted initially to see if there was a word for the English &amp;quot;indenture&amp;quot; as in &amp;quot;indentured servitude&amp;quot;.&amp;nbsp; There wasn&amp;#39;t one, at least not in the online dictionary I use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So then I took out the &amp;quot;ure&amp;quot; and looked up &amp;quot;indent&amp;quot;.&amp;nbsp; It gave me a corresponding word in Irish. Forgot it already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I took out the &amp;quot;in&amp;quot; and looked up &amp;quot;dent&amp;quot;.&amp;nbsp; There were two words that came up, &amp;quot;log&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;ding&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That made me realize that we have a very common expression in English (at least in the US, I can&amp;#39;t say one way or the other about England at the moment), when someone has a minor accident with their car, they will frequently say, &amp;quot;I got a little ding in my car.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp; I never thought about this being a possible borrowing from Irish, but...what do you think?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, I think that&amp;#39;s pretty much it, Dale. When the word is framed between the two pronouns it becomes specific.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four living ex-Presidents? Ceathrar iar-Uachtar&amp;aacute;n at&amp;aacute; f&amp;oacute;s beo.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I didn&amp;#39;t know that about rhyme/rime but I will certainly remember it. There are several words in Irish which don&amp;#39;t really exist (ghost words, they call them) but came about as a result of mistakes, a bit like this. Cigire for inspector is one of them, and dialann for diary is another.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

The second iteration of é has the effect of rendering importance to the first one, making it specific, but it is a second reference to the same thing.  Maybe not &amp;quot;redundant&amp;quot; in the strictest sense of the word, as it does serve a purpose, but it is reiterative as a way of providing emphasis.  English sometimes uses repetition for emphasis as well, but it doesn&amp;#39;t seem to be in the same way.

Since you brought up the President, I was curious...since we have I think four living ex-Presidents, how would you say that in Irish?  In that sence the current President is not &amp;quot;the only President currently in existence&amp;quot; but he is the only one currently in office.  I grant you a fine distinction, but former Presidents are still referred to as &amp;quot;Mr. President&amp;quot;, and no distinction is made in that address to the fact that he is an ex-president.

As to the pronunciation of &amp;quot;is ea&amp;quot; &amp;quot;shea&amp;quot; to rime with &amp;quot;yeah&amp;quot;, that is also the pronunciation found on the Buntús Cainte tapes/CDs, so it must also be the Leinster pronunciation.

And a note for you regarding English...but it&amp;#39;s a fine point lost on most everyone these days:  The actual word is &amp;quot;rime&amp;quot;, not &amp;quot;rhyme&amp;quot;.  The spelling &amp;quot;rhyme&amp;quot; was coned by a poet who wrote the words &amp;quot;rhythm and rime&amp;quot; together, and gave the alternate spelling as a way to make them look related or associated to one another for the purpose of his work.  Many people are in the habit of misspelling &amp;quot;rime&amp;quot; ever since then.....

&lt;p&gt;If you do use the southern form, it has to be &amp;quot;M&amp;aacute;s &amp;eacute; do thoil &amp;eacute;&amp;quot;, which means &amp;quot;If it is your will&amp;quot;. The &amp;eacute; is doubled in sentences like this when the noun is a specific thing, the one and only. In other words, if you are talking about the President, you would say &amp;quot;Is &amp;eacute; Uachtar&amp;aacute;n Mheirice&amp;aacute; &amp;eacute;&amp;quot; = He is THE President, the only president currently in existence.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most speakers of Irish would say shaa, but in some dialects it would be shea to rhyme with yeah. Most Donegal speakers would say it like that ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="clear:both;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description></item><item><title>Re: Irish words in English</title><link>http://talkirish.com/forums/thread/7472.aspx</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 May 2012 19:15:14 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">0644754f-ff87-49dd-b5e3-0e104f790f4a:7472</guid><dc:creator>Dale D</dc:creator><slash:comments>0</slash:comments><comments>http://talkirish.com/forums/thread/7472.aspx</comments><wfw:commentRss>http://talkirish.com/forums/commentrss.aspx?SectionID=7&amp;PostID=7472</wfw:commentRss><description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;m&amp;aacute;s &amp;eacute; do thoil &amp;eacute;&amp;quot; -- &amp;quot;if it pleases you&amp;quot; (is that the correct translation?)&amp;nbsp; My assumptions are probably incorrect, but it just appears that the &amp;quot;&amp;eacute;&amp;quot; is redundant, but that probably comes from thinking in English.....&amp;nbsp; My apologies if I am incorrect (it&amp;#39;s happened once or twice).&amp;nbsp; In Hyberno-English, it is very often found (in my experience anyway) that someone will reiterate a thought or component of the expression in a couple of different ways.&amp;nbsp; &amp;quot;The weather is very wet today, so it is.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp; In most usage, this seems to be&amp;nbsp;reduced to &amp;quot;so&amp;quot; in the South, but that&amp;#39;s what I have gathered from my observation.&amp;nbsp; If I am incorrect, please enlighten me.&amp;nbsp; It just seemed redundant to me.....&lt;/p&gt;

Slew sounds very close to the Irish word slua, meaning crowd, which would be used in exactly the same way - &amp;quot;Bh&amp;iacute; slua daoine ansin&amp;quot;. The problem with many of the fanciful derivations from Irish is that they only have some slight connection to the meaning, they only sound a bit like the word in the other language and in many cases they aren&amp;#39;t the same kind of word, so they couldn&amp;#39;t be used in the same way. Thus an adjective is being compared to a noun, a noun to a verb or even a phrase to a noun. For example, Cassidy in his strange book on American slang claimed that dukin&amp;#39; (as in fighting) comes from the Irish tuargain. Not only is tuargain not very close to dukin in sound, but dukin&amp;#39; seems to be derived from an earlier word dukes, meaning fists. There are various theories about how that word originated but none of them involve Irish, so tuargain is a pretty silly suggestion as an origin of dukin&amp;#39;. Cassidy also suggested &amp;quot;Is cam &amp;eacute;&amp;quot; (It&amp;#39;s crooked) for the origin of scam. But why would you use a phrase like this - &amp;quot;This is a complete &lt;i&gt;it&amp;#39;s crooked&lt;/i&gt;&amp;quot;? When people borrow a word, they tend to use it in the same way in both languages, like the example above with slew/slua.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="clear:both;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description></item><item><title>Re: Irish words in English</title><link>http://talkirish.com/forums/thread/7243.aspx</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Mar 2012 15:37:28 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">0644754f-ff87-49dd-b5e3-0e104f790f4a:7243</guid><dc:creator>seano</dc:creator><slash:comments>0</slash:comments><comments>http://talkirish.com/forums/thread/7243.aspx</comments><wfw:commentRss>http://talkirish.com/forums/commentrss.aspx?SectionID=7&amp;PostID=7243</wfw:commentRss><description>&lt;p&gt;Hi Dale, Yes, there are a number of these expressions which became particularly popular as part of the vocabulary of the &amp;quot;stage Irishman&amp;quot;, phrases like &amp;quot;sure and begorrah&amp;quot;. These are Hiberno-English expressions (= the English of Ireland). I&amp;#39;ll explain in a minute where these particular words come from but first of all, I&amp;#39;ll make a few general points about &amp;quot;swearwords&amp;quot; or taboo language. Generally, taboo words are either sexual or religious. Hundreds of years ago, most of the English taboo words were religious and most people swore by invoking God, Jesus, the Virgin Mary or various saints. These days, of course, with the weakening of religious belief, most people no longer regard these words as taboo, so they are used less than the sexual words. Generally, when something is a taboo word, it generates a number of alternative versions which allow you to swear without taking God&amp;#39;s name in vain or using explicitly sexual language. Thus we get words like Jeepers Creepers instead of Jesus Christ, Blimey for God blind me!, darn it or dang it instead of damn it, Begorrah instead of By God! We also get this in Irish - daingni&amp;uacute; air (consolidation on it) is used instead of damn&amp;uacute; air (damnation on it). This may be the origin of dang it in American speech. And we also say dar fia (by the deer) instead of dar Dia (by God). So, that&amp;#39;s what begorrah is. A way of avoiding saying By God!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Batman was great! My favourite line in it was when Robin was thrown off a tall building with his hands tied behind his back. Batman threw down the Batrope and Robin caught it in his teeth and was hauled up. When Batman untied him, he said, &amp;quot;Gee Batman, I&amp;#39;m glad I kept my teeth in good order.&amp;quot; Whereupon Batman put his hand on his shoulder and said, in a solemn voice: &amp;quot;Yes Robin! You owe your life to dental hygiene ...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole programme was very tongue-in-cheek and great fun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="clear:both;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description></item><item><title>Re: Irish words in English</title><link>http://talkirish.com/forums/thread/7239.aspx</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Mar 2012 18:21:33 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">0644754f-ff87-49dd-b5e3-0e104f790f4a:7239</guid><dc:creator>Dale D</dc:creator><slash:comments>0</slash:comments><comments>http://talkirish.com/forums/thread/7239.aspx</comments><wfw:commentRss>http://talkirish.com/forums/commentrss.aspx?SectionID=7&amp;PostID=7239</wfw:commentRss><description>&lt;p&gt;Hey, on the subject of Irish words in English...I have one that is really a question and needs a bit of background from me....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a very well known expression attributed to the Irish here in the US at least, but in two years living in Ireland, I only heard an Irish person say it once, and that was in the context of a joke.&amp;nbsp; The term is &amp;quot;begorah&amp;quot; (sp?)&amp;nbsp; and is most commonly said in conjunction with another term, such as &amp;quot;Sure and begorah...&amp;quot; or I also remember Chief O&amp;#39;Hara on the Batman TV series saying &amp;quot;Faith and begorah&amp;quot;....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So...is this a genuine Irish term?&amp;nbsp; If so, what does it mean?&amp;nbsp; If not, any conjectures as to its origin and why it seems to be prevalent in the US and not so much in the land to which it is attributed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thoughts?......&lt;/p&gt;
