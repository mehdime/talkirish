Please bear this in mind when posting messages. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try to find the forum that suits you best. If it&amp;#39;s not here, email us and we&amp;#39;ll organise it for you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may enter into chats about the use of the Irish language, which may lead to disagreement. Try to agree to differ in a civilised way. Don&amp;#39;t use language or personal abuse that others may find offensive. Abusive or offensive messages may be deleted without notice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Irish language has three main dialects. It can be useful to note which dialect you are using. Sometimes people prefer one dialect over another. It&amp;#39;s important that you don&amp;#39;t make a value judgement on which dialect is &amp;#39;better&amp;#39; than the others. Each dialect is unique and important, and used by many speakers. Try not to disparage a dialect that is &amp;#39;different&amp;#39; to yours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Monitoring&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Talk Irish forums are not monitored. If you receive an unpleasant message, or one that makes you feel uncomfortable, don&amp;rsquo;t reply to it. You can report it to us. You can also notify us of other inappropriate use, such as advertising. Include the forum name and some details to help us identify the post. We&amp;rsquo;ll take appropriate action against postings and users who misuse the forums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Post on topic&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Keeping on-topic makes forums easier to follow and more constructive to use, so make sure your posts are relevant to the topic being discussed. Talk Irish may delete posts that appear irrelevant to the discussion in which they&amp;rsquo;re posted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Keep your personal information safe&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;By adding content to your user profile, you can let other users know more about you. This can help you make friends and enrich the Talk Irish community. But it&amp;rsquo;s best not to give out your full address or phone number of your home, work or school either on your profile or in the forum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your profile can only be viewed by other Talk Irish members. However, the forums are public. If you disclose personal information online, it could be collected and used by third parties to send you unsolicited materials.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be cautious when sharing your email address. If you do give out your email address, don&amp;rsquo;t open emails from people you don&amp;rsquo;t know. Don&amp;rsquo;t open emails with attachments from people you don&amp;rsquo;t know &amp;ndash; they could be carrying viruses or malicious programmes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Meeting people&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;You may meet a language partner online, who you would like to meet up with to practice Irish face-to-face. You must be careful about meeting other forum users, as it is very easy for people to pretend to be someone they&amp;rsquo;re not. Follow these guidelines when agreeing a meet-up:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;b&gt;Under 18s:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Always ask your parent(s) or guardian(s) first.&lt;br /&gt;2. Ask your parent(s) to go with you.&lt;br /&gt;3. Always meet in a public place of your choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;b&gt;Over 18s:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Get a friend to accompany you.&lt;br /&gt;2. Always tell someone you trust about where, when, and who you are meeting.&lt;br /&gt;3. Always meet in a public place of your choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
