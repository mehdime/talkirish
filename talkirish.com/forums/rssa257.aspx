&lt;p&gt;Allow me first to say that this is not a site that sp3cializes in translation, but is rather for those who are learning Irish.&amp;nbsp; By definition, that probably makes it a more risky option for pursuing a translation, and in many cases some will probably decline any attempt at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The translation of what you haveoffered is (roughly) &amp;quot;House of the Ridge above the Bay&amp;quot;; however, I have some misgivings about the grammar of what you have provided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be a correct Irish construct, &amp;quot;Ridge&amp;quot; (Dromainn&amp;quot; should be rendered in the genetive case as a possessive.&amp;nbsp; To place it into the genetive format, an &amp;quot;e&amp;quot; should be added at the end:&amp;nbsp; &amp;quot;Dromainne&amp;quot; giving &amp;quot;Teach Dromainne Os Cionn Na B&amp;aacute;&amp;quot;.&amp;nbsp; (Please note that the &amp;quot;a&amp;quot; in B&amp;aacute; has a fada (accent mark) above it.&amp;nbsp; I know you used an apostrophe, but not everyone knows how to apply the accent/fada onto vowels on the computer or other electronic devices.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am thinking, though, that a more correct phrasology would be:&amp;nbsp; &amp;quot;House on the ridge above the bay&amp;quot;, which would be&amp;nbsp; &amp;quot;Teach Ar An Dromainn Os Cionn an Bh&amp;aacute;&amp;quot;.&amp;nbsp; The genetive &amp;quot;Na B&amp;aacute;&amp;quot; at the conclusion of your version does not seem, to me at least, to go with &amp;quot;Os Cionn&amp;quot; &amp;quot;above&amp;quot;.&amp;nbsp; Also the term &amp;quot;B&amp;aacute;&amp;quot; in this instance seems not to need the genetive case, because of the &amp;quot;above&amp;quot; term that precedes it.&amp;nbsp; As a feminine noun, it would be lenited &amp;quot;an bh&amp;aacute;&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My next concern is with the use of the word &amp;quot;Dromainn&amp;quot; for &amp;quot;ridge&amp;quot;; it does have that meaning, but also means &amp;quot;mound&amp;quot; and seems related to the word &amp;quot;Droim&amp;quot; which is another word used for ridge, but also means &amp;quot;back&amp;quot; as in a person&amp;#39;s back.&amp;nbsp; I am wondering if the term &amp;quot;mullach&amp;quot; might be better, which means &amp;quot;highest point&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;summit&amp;quot; but also includes geography-specific meanings of &amp;quot;elevated ground, height or emminence&amp;quot;.&amp;nbsp; I am not saying that &amp;quot;Dromainn&amp;#39; is wrong, but wonder if &amp;quot;Mullach&amp;quot; might be a more appropriate choice.&amp;nbsp; That would result in &amp;quot;Teach Ar An Mullach Os Cionn An Bh&amp;aacute;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I have to tell you that I am no where near fluent in Irish, and consider myself still a learner.&amp;nbsp; There may be others on this site, or on sites more dedicated to translation services, who may disagree with me on some, several, or all points which I have included in this missive.&amp;nbsp; Please remember that I am not native, or fluent, so anything I offer must be viewed in that light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dale D&lt;/p&gt;

I have a translation favor to ask, please. My mom and dad&amp;#39;s house has a faded, old address wall plate that I&amp;#39;d like to replace with a new one for them. My mom&amp;#39;s from Co Kerry; dad from Galway. But I grew up in the US (and don&amp;#39;t speak Irish). The parents once lived in a neighborhood of NYC years ago called, &amp;#39;Bay Ridge&amp;#39;, which is in NYC&amp;#39;s borough of Brooklyn. On their house address wall plate, they dubbed the home, &amp;#39;Bay Ridge House&amp;#39;. It was written in English. For the new address wall plate I want to surprise them with, I&amp;#39;d like to have that written in Irish. I did some of my own, clumsy, uneducated research; and, came up with the following Irish translation: &amp;#39;Teach Dromainn Os Cionn Na Ba&amp;#39;.  Could someone knowledgeable please tell me if that is the correct or best translation, please?? I would greatly appreciate help. Thank you so much!!!   ---Kevin&lt;div style="clear:both;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
