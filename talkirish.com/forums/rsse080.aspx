I suggest contributing to &lt;a target="_self" href="http://talkirish.com/forums/t/3812.aspx"&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; instead of starting &lt;i&gt;another&lt;/i&gt; thread on the &lt;i&gt;same&lt;/i&gt; subject (however, what&amp;#39;s done is done); you can still talk about your speaking level and ideas there. There are endless amounts of threads and users who are looking for study partners, so why not PM one or more of those people and ask about practicing with them? I&amp;#39;m not being mean, I promise, I just think it&amp;#39;s both tiring and pointless to check the forums to see another thread on a subject that&amp;#39;s been talked of over and over all over the place. Think of how aggravating it is for a learner to sift through the boards trying to find a particular subject only to be bombarded by the same exact stuff &lt;i&gt;page&lt;/i&gt; after &lt;i&gt;page&lt;/i&gt;. Frustrating, right? And then they give up trying to find &lt;i&gt;their&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;desired subject (though it exists) and decide to start &lt;i&gt;another&lt;/i&gt; thread on that &lt;i&gt;one&lt;/i&gt; subject which just further contributes to clogging the boards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="clear:both;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description></item><item><title>Re: Irish Conversation &amp; Communication Practice using Skype</title><link>http://talkirish.com/forums/thread/7683.aspx</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Aug 2012 19:14:23 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">0644754f-ff87-49dd-b5e3-0e104f790f4a:7683</guid><dc:creator>Maxtro</dc:creator><slash:comments>0</slash:comments><comments>http://talkirish.com/forums/thread/7683.aspx</comments><wfw:commentRss>http://talkirish.com/forums/commentrss.aspx?SectionID=7&amp;PostID=7683</wfw:commentRss><description>Excellent.

I&amp;#39;m also looking for someone (or more) to help me practice Irish. I&amp;#39;m definitely a beginner, I&amp;#39;ve been studying it for about 6 months but I think I&amp;#39;d learn a lot faster conversing with a native Irish speaker. If anyone is available/interested let me know. Thank you!!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="clear:both;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description></item><item><title>Re: Irish Conversation &amp; Communication Practice using Skype</title><link>http://talkirish.com/forums/thread/7645.aspx</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Aug 2012 17:00:37 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">0644754f-ff87-49dd-b5e3-0e104f790f4a:7645</guid><dc:creator>Oneile33</dc:creator><slash:comments>0</slash:comments><comments>http://talkirish.com/forums/thread/7645.aspx</comments><wfw:commentRss>http://talkirish.com/forums/commentrss.aspx?SectionID=7&amp;PostID=7645</wfw:commentRss><description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d be delighted to have such conversations over skype.

I know there have been dozens of posts like this.  People looking for language partners to practice their convsersation over Skype or tother similar such programs.  I&amp;#39;m looking for the same, but first here&amp;#39;s some details about myself.  I&amp;#39;ve been learning Irish for about a year and though I am making progress, I feel that it&amp;#39;s going much slower than it could mainly due to the fact that I haven&amp;#39;t had the opportunity to use it in conversation.  So if anyone is interested.  I&amp;#39;d like to start up or become part of a Skype communication group, either with a single person, but ideally, I think it would be great to get multiple people together on a Skype conference call.  It could become like a weekly meetup group type setting.

A little information about myself:

I&amp;#39;m 27 years old and I live in Oak Harbor, WA, USA (located in the Pacific Standard Time zone).  It&amp;#39;s a very small town with little to no opportunity to practice speaking Irish in the local area despite the fact that there seem to be quite a lot of people of Irish heritage.  There are a few highland games events in the area throughout the year but all I&amp;#39;ve been able to find at those are a few select people who are in the very early stages of learning Scottish Gaelic.

Anyway, I&amp;#39;m a firm believer that speaking the language regularly can and will result in faster progress.  I&amp;#39;ve come to this conclusion due to my slow progress from not speaking.  If there is anyone who would be interested in such a group, please let me know and I can pass you my Skype name.  Perhaps if it takes off we can even put a profile up on meetup.com to help others find the group.  Again I am in the Pacific Standard Time zone.  I include this information because I realize that time zone and location differences can become a bit of an obstacle for arranging phone conversations/meetings.  Anyone is welcome of course.  I think this could be a great way to converse, recommend learning tools, and just get people speaking in Irish.  

I look forward to seeing what everyone thinks of this idea.  I have researched this on the Skype website and it appears that with a free account, free converence calling (computer to computer) is included (at least here in the USA).  I do believe they charge if you would like to be able to use the feature on your mobile phone.

I look forward to any comments/suggestions.  Thank you in advance.
