I am not the best person to answer it because my Irish is basically Ulster. I haven&amp;#39;t spent much time in other Gaeltacht areas and I don&amp;#39;t know a huge amount about the differences between them. My understanding is that the speakers on Bunt&amp;uacute;s Cainte are all Connacht speakers. There are certainly no Ulster men or women in there. I think Tom&amp;aacute;s &amp;Oacute; Domhnall&amp;aacute;in, who wrote the scripts for the series, was also a Connachtach. As far as I know, Conas at&amp;aacute; t&amp;uacute; is a Munster form, as you say, so it is hard to explain what it is doing here. Perhaps it was included in deference to the Munster dialect, which certain revivalists always regarded as the best and purest form of Irish (without any evidence which a modern linguist would accept, I might add). I wonder if there are any speakers of Connacht Irish out there who could tell us if there is anything else which is typical of Munster Irish in the series?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="clear:both;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description></item><item><title>Dialect</title><link>http://talkirish.com/forums/thread/6405.aspx</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Jan 2011 15:13:49 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">0644754f-ff87-49dd-b5e3-0e104f790f4a:6405</guid><dc:creator>Murphy23</dc:creator><slash:comments>0</slash:comments><comments>http://talkirish.com/forums/thread/6405.aspx</comments><wfw:commentRss>http://talkirish.com/forums/commentrss.aspx?SectionID=41&amp;PostID=6405</wfw:commentRss><description>&lt;p&gt;Which dialect does Buntas Cainte lean too?&amp;nbsp; I understand that its the Official Standard but does it have a leaning?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example how are you?&amp;nbsp; Is Conas ata tu in 3 but not in Connacht.&amp;nbsp; Is there any Connacht in there?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="clear:both;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
