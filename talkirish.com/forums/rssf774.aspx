&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TalkIrish is back online and as am I.&amp;nbsp; It&amp;#39;s been quite a while since I&amp;#39;ve been here but I have come back to observe once in a while.&amp;nbsp; I remember quite a while ago speaking on the fact that I was more motivated than ever to pick the language back up and continue learning.&amp;nbsp; I mentioned how hard it is to do this alone and how that was a major downfall for my past experiences.&amp;nbsp; I should&amp;#39;ve expected that the same thing was going to happen again since that post.&amp;nbsp; As the saying goes, &amp;quot;Doing something over and over again and expecting different results&amp;quot; is the definition of insanity.&amp;nbsp; This has been and will always be a cycle for me until something changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m slightly motivated to jump back into it.&amp;nbsp; I did have suggestions last time that I continue to believe would help.&amp;nbsp; For any other newcomers here that are willing to learn the language, a group effort is needed for great results.&amp;nbsp; I really believe weekly lessons that everybody can follow along with and join in would help immensely.&amp;nbsp; Coming back here on the 7th day to discuss, or even Skype or FaceTime or use the Facebook video chat, to help with pronunciation and conversation.&amp;nbsp; And then setting up the following weeks lesson and so on.&amp;nbsp; If there are any fluent speakers on here that would take the role as the teacher(or multiple teachers) and guide us through the lessons weekly, coming up with assignments or online paperwork, that would be fantastic and extremely inspirational.&amp;nbsp; Any issues or questions we have could be answered on the spot.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Anybody who is onboard with this idea feel free to join in on the conversation.&amp;nbsp; I&amp;#39;m frustrated with my lack of commitment and I want to finally break the cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Ryan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="clear:both;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
