&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m happy to respond to posts on the forum, and help with what I know, but I&amp;#39;m far from fluent, and wouldn&amp;#39;t want to make a commitment to something I&amp;#39;m not so sure of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your stories seem quite simple and don&amp;#39;t involve a lot of vocabulary.&amp;nbsp; I would suggest that you start with some rudimentary Irish grammar and build as you go, so you can get to a point where you can handle most of the basics on your own.&amp;nbsp; Then as you have questions you can bring them up with just a few corrections needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s lots of good stuff on line to help you learn, and that&amp;#39;s what this site is really about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;thank you for such an indepth and detailed response- it was exactly this type of feedback that i was hoping for. &amp;nbsp;Would you consider perhaps helping with the translations?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am ashamed to say that I know very little Irish and am quite the learner- my eldest son is studying it and my wife knows only what she learnt in school. &amp;nbsp;therefore I need someone with a good depth to their knowledge for such a project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me know, and thank you again&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JD&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like your website concept, it&amp;#39;s very cute!&amp;nbsp; I also like the very basic stories with Farg.&amp;nbsp; I have several things to offer, particularly as pertains to Irish grammar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1.&amp;nbsp; You seem to be doing a word-for-word translation of English to Irish, which pays no attention to Irish sentence structure.&amp;nbsp; Irish sentences are constructed in VSO order -- that is, Verb, Subject, Object.&amp;nbsp; In English, we are used to having the verb separate the subject and object, but Irish is quite different.&amp;nbsp; So, for example, frame 1 of your story about the dam has &amp;quot;An Tollamh Tinklebottom chinneann chun planda&amp;iacute; a buama ar an damba sna cnoic thuas Fargs teach.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp; The English version is, &amp;quot;Professor Tinklebottom decides to plant a bomb on the dam in the hills above Farg&amp;#39;s house.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp; Assuming your verb &amp;quot;chinnean&amp;quot; is correct for &amp;quot;decides&amp;quot;, the sentence should place the verb first, ahead of the subject.&amp;nbsp; But in looking up &amp;quot;cinn&amp;quot; my online dictionary shows it as an intransitive verb, and it doesn&amp;#39;t show a standard conjugation.&amp;nbsp; It shows &amp;quot;cinneadh air&amp;quot; as &amp;quot;making up one&amp;#39;s mind.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp; I might suggest using the verb &amp;quot;beartaigh&amp;quot; which means &amp;quot;to contrive, scheme, or wield&amp;quot;, and the third person singular would be &amp;quot;bearta&amp;iacute;onn&amp;quot;.&amp;nbsp; So your sentence would start out &amp;quot;Bearta&amp;iacute;onn an Tollamh Tinklebottom ....&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2.&amp;nbsp; &amp;quot;Plant&amp;quot; as a verb is &amp;quot;plandaigh&amp;quot;, and I think &amp;quot;pland&amp;aacute;il&amp;quot; is the verbal noun form, so change &amp;quot;planda&amp;iacute;&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;pland&amp;aacute;il&amp;quot;. and restructure that part of the sentence:&amp;nbsp; &amp;quot;Bearta&amp;iacute;onn an Tollamh Tinkelbottom ar pland&amp;aacute;il buama ar an damba sna cnoic thuas ....&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp; Please note the elimination of the indefinite article &amp;quot;a&amp;quot; before &amp;quot;buama&amp;quot; as there is no indefinite article in Irish, and the particle &amp;quot;a&amp;quot; inserted there (which can be used a number of ways) would be incredibly confusing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3.&amp;nbsp; The name of the person who possesses the house &amp;quot;teach&amp;quot; should follow rather than precede the word, and the definite article can be added:&amp;nbsp; &amp;quot;Bearta&amp;iacute;onn an Tollamh Tinkelbottom ar pland&amp;aacute;il buama ar an damba sna cnoic thuas an teach Farg.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There may be some better construct for this, but I&amp;#39;m still quite a learner myself....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of your other frames have similar issues.&amp;nbsp; Obviously some words you were unable to find a good translation or alternative for, such as &amp;quot;whizzing&amp;quot; in frame 2.&amp;nbsp; (For that one, I might suggest &amp;quot;scinneadh thart&amp;quot; which means &amp;quot;to flash by or past&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Frame 3, you have a like problem with the verb not being first, and at the end of the sentence you should have &amp;quot;damba nua s&amp;iacute;os sruth&amp;quot; as &amp;quot;new&amp;quot; applies to the dam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Frame 4, again, verb first, and an Irish one, not English:&amp;nbsp; &amp;quot;Pl&amp;eacute;ascann an buama!&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp; &amp;quot;The bomb explodes!&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp; The construct of the next sentence looks pretty strange, and it needs going over in more detail; the last sentence should be, &amp;quot;T&amp;aacute; an Tollamh Tinklebottom bactha ar&amp;iacute;s!&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp; &amp;quot;Professor Tinklebottom is frustrated/thwarted again!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also in Frame 4, on the art work, in the English version, you show Tinklebottom yelling, &amp;quot;NO!&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp; In the Irish artwork he yells, &amp;quot;AON!&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Aon&amp;quot; is Irish for &amp;quot;one&amp;quot; as in the number, and is not what he would yell to show his frustration.&amp;nbsp; &amp;quot;N&amp;iacute; hea!&amp;quot; is the retort I have seen used in several places, &amp;quot;Not that!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the same art, you use the English &amp;quot;BOOM!&amp;quot; in both places for the bomb&amp;#39;s explosion.&amp;nbsp; This may be ok, but if you want to substitute an Irish term on the Irish version, I would suggest &amp;quot;B&amp;uacute;IREACH!&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp; (With a capital U-fada of course; I can&amp;#39;t locate my shortcut for the capitals with fadas on them....)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not sure where you are with your study of Irish, but it is good to ask for help with a project like this.&amp;nbsp; I still consider myself a learner, but I&amp;#39;m happy to pass on what I&amp;#39;m comfortable with.&amp;nbsp; Sometimes I go out a little on a limb, and usually se&amp;aacute;n&amp;oacute; comes to my rescue!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;

If not what would you like to see changed to make it better.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;We have started to add basic Irish- does this need more elaboration? &amp;nbsp;What would work best?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;Are the characters right? Stories are light on the ground at present (a work in progress) but I would like to have your feedback so that we can shape it towards users advice.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;Thanks in advance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;JD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="clear:both;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
