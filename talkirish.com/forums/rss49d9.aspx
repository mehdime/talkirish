&lt;div&gt;First of all, there are several MA courses available in Ireland for translators. I did the one in QUB and I found it excellent. To make the most of your time on the course, I would suggest just a few tips:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Make sure you read and learn&amp;nbsp;the sections in the grammar books on s&amp;eacute;imhi&amp;uacute;, ur&amp;uacute;, and the numbers, or any aspect of the grammar you have problems with&amp;nbsp;- courses like these are designed to deal with the things you can&amp;#39;t get from those books.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Read as much good Irish as you can - novels by Gaeltacht authors, factual books etc.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Try getting some good translated material (ask your lecturer) in both versions and translate the English, then compare your version to the ideal Irish translation. This should highlight where the problems are and help you to resolve them.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Get the book Cuir Gaeilge Air, which has a lot of useful advice and a list of common mistakes to avoid.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Learn to paraphrase: in other words, take a piece of English and learn to rewrite it in such a way that you preserve the essential meaning but make it much easier to translate.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;And above all, enjoy it!&amp;nbsp; Learning is always much more difficult if you&amp;#39;re apprehensive or bored, so make sure you start each session with a positive attitude.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="clear:both;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description></item><item><title>Advice for student beginning MA in Irish Translation?</title><link>http://talkirish.com/forums/thread/4020.aspx</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Oct 2009 08:32:05 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">0644754f-ff87-49dd-b5e3-0e104f790f4a:4020</guid><dc:creator>seamróg00</dc:creator><slash:comments>0</slash:comments><comments>http://talkirish.com/forums/thread/4020.aspx</comments><wfw:commentRss>http://talkirish.com/forums/commentrss.aspx?SectionID=7&amp;PostID=4020</wfw:commentRss><description>&lt;p&gt;Hello all,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have just begun a Masters in Irish Translation and am feeling a bit overwhelmed as Im not sure what the best way is to go about improving my irish writing skills. If any of you have any advice for the best way to work towards being a translator please leave a comment as I would really appreciate your advice on the subject! Would be great to hear from anyone who has done the Masters in Irish Translation and if they could let me know what they thought of the course, what the challenges were and how they successfully managed the course!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="clear:both;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
