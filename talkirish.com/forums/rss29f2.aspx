&lt;p&gt;Your posts and/or attempted posts have been deleted.&amp;nbsp; They will continue to be deleted as soon as I see them.&amp;nbsp; Your account will also be deleted as a SPAM offender.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same applies to those persons posting items for business concerns in China, or who are advertising for the sale of fake documents, watches, clothing, anything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your account is deleted &lt;i&gt;immediately &lt;/i&gt;because you are attempting to SPAM our group.&amp;nbsp; Such is considered an ILLIGITIMATE USE OF THIS SITE!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So just stop already.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can delete them as fast as you post or attempt to post them.&amp;nbsp; When you create a new member account, your posts begin by going into the Moderated Posts file, where I see them before anyone else.&amp;nbsp; When that happens, they never see the light of day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please leave us alone.&amp;nbsp; Your traffic is not wanted and will continue to be DELETED immediately, along with user accounts of offenders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good-bye.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="clear:both;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
