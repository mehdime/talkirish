&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re very right that lots of Protestant Scots were given land during the Plantation of Ulster. Many Protestant English were also given land. This was in an attempt colonise and pacify the territory. Read more at wikipedia &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plantation_of_Ulster"&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plantation_of_Ulster&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, the tensions resulting from the plantations have persisted until today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But before the plantation of Ulster, the North of Ireland had very close links to Scotland, to its culture and language. In the days before we had roads, our rivers and seas were our highways. You can see Scotland from much of the North, and close connections have existed between the countries for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve heard it said that years ago, people in Antrim used to row to Scotland for a dance, that being an easier night out than taking a poor road to somewhere on the island of Ireland! I believe that Irish was spoken until quite recently in the Glens of Antrim - the 1950s? Sorry - none of this is an area I&amp;#39;m particularly expert on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another language that&amp;#39;s often missed in comparisons between Scottish Gaelic and Irish is the Manx language (once extinct, now being reintroduced at schools and
in learning circles). It is very similar to both Scottish Gaelic and Irish,
except that it was written down by an English man, so it&amp;#39;s phonetic. It makes it quite easy for an English speaker to pick up a basic words and phrases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My daughter and grandson live in Co. Antrim and I go there frequently. After four years, or so, I still have difficulty understanding my son-in-law&amp;quot;s &amp;quot;English.&amp;quot; Same for his brothers. The distaff side is much easier to understand. It is interesting to hear them slenderize words; e.g., cyar for car and byeg for big. And of course wee is preferred over small. Most of the lads know some Irish through GAA. The local Sinn Fein rep always speaks to me in Irish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;History note (please correct me if needed, Michelle): Didn&amp;#39;t the Ulster-Scots (or what is referred to here as Scots-Irish) result from the plantation, when the English sent folks over as place-holding landowners?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just for grins, check out the story of the Ballycopeland Windmill (Co. Down) and see the differenct between Irish and Ulster-Scots:&lt;/p&gt;

Agus go raibh m&amp;iacute;le maith agat for all the useful information!! You have answered so many questions for me!!&amp;nbsp; My grandfather always said that we were Irish so of course we grew up saying we were Irish...came from Co. Antrim. And they spoke a few Irish words here and there. So you can just imagine my shock when&amp;nbsp;I was doing my family tree and it traced the Pollocks back Co. Antrim and&amp;nbsp;to Glasgow Scotland. Then I began recieving newsletters from my Pollock side and it was always titled Ulster-Scots. So off to the &amp;quot;Computer world&amp;quot; I went in seach of &amp;quot;What is the Ulster /Scots?&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp; And it left me more confused than when I started! lol So I asked a distant cousin of mine to please explain it to me and she said basically, it&amp;#39;s the best of both worlds because we are a mixture of Irish and Scots.lol Great way to look at it!&amp;nbsp;Oh and I have been looking at the Colin and Cumberland site using the Scots language and I agree with you 100% as it is so much like Irish that I believe if you can speak Irish, you can speak Scots. Or at least the Ulster/Scots. So now , thanks to you my friend, I finally know the meaning of Ulster/Scots!&amp;nbsp; I really appreciate your help and for the sites you sent. I am so thankful to you that you started this wonderful site!!&amp;nbsp; I have, not only learned alot of Irish, but also met wonderful people such as yourself and alot of other useful information as well. Again, go raibh m&amp;iacute;le maith!!&amp;nbsp; Bain sult as an l&amp;aacute;!&amp;nbsp; Sl&amp;aacute;n, Deb&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="clear:both;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description></item><item><title>Re: Ulster-Scots</title><link>http://talkirish.com/forums/thread/1333.aspx</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Feb 2009 10:21:49 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">0644754f-ff87-49dd-b5e3-0e104f790f4a:1333</guid><dc:creator>michelle</dc:creator><slash:comments>0</slash:comments><comments>http://talkirish.com/forums/thread/1333.aspx</comments><wfw:commentRss>http://talkirish.com/forums/commentrss.aspx?SectionID=7&amp;PostID=1333</wfw:commentRss><description>&lt;p&gt;Dia is Muire duit,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course you can ask about Ulster-Scots here! I can&amp;#39;t answer all your questions, but I&amp;#39;ll try and give you some help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know what language your family would have spoken either in Antrim or in Scotland in the 16th century. They could have spoken any of the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Irish&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;English&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scottish Gaelic (ancient Celtic language, like Irish, still surviving mostly in the Scottish highlands)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scots (a mixture of Scots Gaelic and English, still spoken widely in Scotland today)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;several of the above&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Irish was spoken in Ulster at that time, as were English, Scots and Scottish Gaelic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ulster-Scots is spoken in Northern Ireland, and also in parts of Donegal. To my ear, it sounds like a mix between the Northern Irish accent and the Scottish accent, but uses some words and constructions that are particular to it. Estimated numbers of speakers range from 30,000 to 100,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where I grew up, we used a lot of words that are described as
Ulster-Scots e.g. drooth (thirst), sleekit (sneaky), and of course
&amp;#39;wee&amp;#39; (small), but we would not have considered ourselves Ulster-Scots
speakers. Part of this is because the Ulster-Scots movement was
considered a Unionist movement and was associated with the Unionist
tradition and identity. People from a nationalist tradition would be more likely to identify their way of speaking as being Hiberno-English - that is, being more influenced by the Irish language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am NOT a linguist, and I&amp;#39;m glad, for they all seem to be fighting over what Ulster-Scots is (is it a language? Is it a dialect? Is it an accent?), who speaks it, why, where and how. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know you want to learn your ancestor&amp;#39;s language. But it will be very difficult for you to first correctly identify and then reconstruct the language they spoke back in the 16th century. The way I see it, a Spanish speaker who decides to learn English to learn more about their English ancestry wouldn&amp;#39;t try to learn Shakespearean English&amp;nbsp;&lt;img src="http://talkirish.com/emoticons/emotion-1.gif" alt="Smile" /&gt; They&amp;#39;d just learn modern English, and use that as a gateway. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By learning Ulster Irish, you will have a great window into Irish across the island of Ireland, but also into Scottish Gaelic in Scotland, as the languages have similarities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to get a better handle on Ulster Scots, check out the links below for audio. Try to listen while reading a transcript.I don&amp;#39;t know of any official courses that teach Ulster-Scots, but if you want to learn more, check out this wikipedia article for a good overview of Ulster Scots history and development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here&amp;#39;s a link to the official, government-funded agency for Ulster Scots in Northern Ireland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good friend of mine worked on creating this website for BBC Northern Ireland - it&amp;#39;s got a great collection of Ulster-Scots interviews with audio files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PS One last little story. When I was 18, I left Tyrone in Northern Ireland to go to college in Trinity, in Dublin. This was a very &amp;#39;posh&amp;#39; university, and I was quite naive at the time. People often commented on my accent. I remember one girl (who sounded English to me, but was actually &amp;#39;posh&amp;#39; Dublin) said to me &amp;#39;What part of Scotland are you from?&amp;#39;. I&amp;#39;d got used to people thinking I was Scottish at this point, so I just said &amp;#39;Tyrone&amp;#39; back to her, thinking that she&amp;#39;d realise her mistake and laugh. However, she just said &amp;#39;Oh really. Is that the highlands or the lowlands?&amp;#39;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="clear:both;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description></item><item><title>Ulster-Scots</title><link>http://talkirish.com/forums/thread/1318.aspx</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2009 13:55:15 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">0644754f-ff87-49dd-b5e3-0e104f790f4a:1318</guid><dc:creator>debra</dc:creator><slash:comments>0</slash:comments><comments>http://talkirish.com/forums/thread/1318.aspx</comments><wfw:commentRss>http://talkirish.com/forums/commentrss.aspx?SectionID=7&amp;PostID=1318</wfw:commentRss><description>&lt;p&gt;Dia duit a Mhichelle! If this isn&amp;#39;t allowed on your site, please&amp;nbsp;remove it for me. Go raibh maith agat. My question is..can someone please explain to me what the Ulster-Scots / Scots-Ulster is? I have been reading up on this since my Pollock line appears to be this. Not being the brightest crayon in the box, I just can&amp;#39;t understand it. And if you type this in yahoo or Google etc. it still comes back to Ireland though it will give you information on Glasgow. Now I do know the Pollocks are one of the oldest families in Scotland. But my main question is..what language would they have spoken..Irish? Scots? And I can&amp;#39;t figure out how you can live in Co. Antrim and still not have been Irish even if you moved to Scotland?!?&amp;nbsp; If you were Chinese and became an American citizen you would still be referred to&amp;nbsp;as Chinese American / American Chinese and the same with African Americans. Though you may be born here in America along with your parents and grandparents, etc. You would still be classified as African American. So you see where my head has started to hurt? lol Anyway, if someone can at least tell me which language this side of my family would have spoken in the 16th century and back and why when you type in Glasgow it still links it with Northern Ireland, I would greatly appreciate it. Thank you, Deb&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="clear:both;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
