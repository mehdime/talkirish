I was kind of joking before but I just wanted to make a serious point that Irish is not a &amp;#39;pure&amp;#39; language, whatever that means. Irish, English, and French&amp;nbsp; are full of borrowings and they are none the worse for that. For example, as you say, French has many borrowings from Celtic.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="clear:both;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description></item><item><title>Re: context?</title><link>http://talkirish.com/forums/thread/5621.aspx</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 May 2010 21:56:39 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">0644754f-ff87-49dd-b5e3-0e104f790f4a:5621</guid><dc:creator>Fand</dc:creator><slash:comments>0</slash:comments><comments>http://talkirish.com/forums/thread/5621.aspx</comments><wfw:commentRss>http://talkirish.com/forums/commentrss.aspx?SectionID=7&amp;PostID=5621</wfw:commentRss><description>&lt;p&gt;Actually, I think you&amp;#39;ve gotten that just backwards- I think it&amp;#39;s French that owes a huge debt to Gaelic! Gaelic is a much, much, older language than French. Looking at Old French, it wasn&amp;#39;t a well-defined language that was clearly distinguished from the other forms of debased Latin used in Medieval Europe until the 12th century C.E. The embroidered language on the Bayuex tapestry isn&amp;#39;t Old French, it&amp;#39;s Medieval Latin. Since I grew up speaking French, I was always interested in all the ways that French isn&amp;#39;t like Latin, &amp;amp; I alsways wondered where all that other stuff came from- until I started to study Gaelic instead of just hearing a few words from my grandmothers. Once I started studying Gaelic, everything fell into place. French is what you get when you cross Latin &amp;amp; Ancient Gaulish, a Celtic language. Granted, Gaulish was a Brythonic language, not a Goidelic one, like Gaelic, but since it was so many thousands of years ago, the Brythonic &amp;amp; Goidelic languages were both much closer to their common ancestral Celtic language, from before we had the two branches that encompass the six modern Celtic lanaguages, which are Irish, Scots, &amp;amp; Manx Gaelic on the Goidelic saide, and Welsh, Cornish &amp;amp; Breton on the Brythonic side, in case anyone&amp;#39;s interested. It also must be mentioned that Seano is right about the French currently spoken as being Norman-derived. The Official French, as outlined by the Academie Fran&amp;ccedil;aise, which is in charge of enforcing the Official standards &amp;amp; protecting &amp;quot;la langue sacr&amp;eacute;e&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;the sacred tongue&amp;quot;, is the Langue d&amp;#39;Oeil or Northern French, as used &amp;amp; developped by the Normans. However, despite what the Academie Fran&amp;ccedil;aise would like to have people believe, all French isn&amp;#39;t Northern, and it took a long time for them to round up all the various dialects of French, set an official standard, &amp;amp; get everyone to go along with it. Because of the power &amp;amp; influence wielded by the Angevin Empire (in the North, the Angevin family is from Anjou, thus the name) the Official standard favors the Northern dialects over the Langue D&amp;#39;Oc, or southern region, including the Kingdom of L&amp;#39;Occitan. My point, and I do have one, is that French is a Medieval language, and didn&amp;#39;t exist before then, whereas Gaelic is one of the world&amp;#39;s oldest languages, being of a similar age to Sanskrit, so I think it is really French that owes a huge debt to Gaelic, so let me just say &amp;quot;Merci Beaucoup aux L&amp;#39;Irlandais! Je vous remerci mille fois!&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Thank you very much to the Irish people! I thank you a thousand times [polite form]!&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="clear:both;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description></item><item><title>Re: context?</title><link>http://talkirish.com/forums/thread/5527.aspx</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 May 2010 05:59:09 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">0644754f-ff87-49dd-b5e3-0e104f790f4a:5527</guid><dc:creator>seano</dc:creator><slash:comments>0</slash:comments><comments>http://talkirish.com/forums/thread/5527.aspx</comments><wfw:commentRss>http://talkirish.com/forums/commentrss.aspx?SectionID=7&amp;PostID=5527</wfw:commentRss><description>&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonjour et merci beaucoup! I am glad of that confirmation, as my French is not great and I was keeping my fingers crossed that I was correct! Apparently you can say bon apr&amp;egrave;s-midi as well but not as a greeting, only when you are saying goodbye and wishing someone a pleasant afternoon. Apologies to anyone who thinks a discussion of French is inappropriate here but it&amp;#39;s just to back up the point that you can&amp;#39;t necessarily find exact equivalents for words between languages, and this doesn&amp;#39;t mean that the other languages are somehow inferior or less expressive because they don&amp;#39;t parcel up reality in the same packages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;And while we&amp;#39;re on the subject of French, I should perhaps point out the massive debt that Irish owes to French. Common words like gars&amp;uacute;n/gas&amp;uacute;r (garcon), p&amp;aacute;iste (page) or seomra (chambre) are derived from French or Norman-French. Other words which many people assume are derived from English are also French or Norman - muisiri&amp;uacute;n is derived from Old French moucheron, (in turn derived from mouche meaning fly); damhsa is also from Norman French.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And how did we repay you? By called rats francaigh and syphilis &amp;quot;an bholgach fhrancach&amp;quot; (the French pox!) Quels ingrats, ces irlandais!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;En Fran&amp;ccedil;ais, you could say &amp;quot;bon matin&amp;quot;, &amp;amp; there&amp;#39;s nothing technically wrong with it, but it is a very unusual usage; people just don&amp;#39;t say it. En Fran&amp;ccedil;ais, we say &amp;quot;Bonjour&amp;quot; [Good Day] or &amp;quot;Ciao&amp;quot; [Hi there], although in the evening, French people do say &amp;quot;Bon soir&amp;quot;, lit., &amp;quot;Good Evening&amp;quot;. While people do say &amp;quot;Bonne Nuit&amp;quot;, usually, they only say that when they&amp;#39;re saying goodbye to people in the evening. &amp;quot;Bonne Nuit&amp;quot; carries the meaning of &amp;quot;Good Night &amp;amp; Good-Bye&amp;quot;. In certain situations in the evening, &amp;quot;Bonne Nuit&amp;quot; can be substituted for &amp;quot;Au Revoir&amp;quot; [lit., &amp;quot;until we see each other again&amp;quot;], but usually, when French-speaking people say &amp;quot;good-bye&amp;quot; to each other, they say &amp;quot;Au Revoir&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;Ciao&amp;quot;. The latter is extremely informal, and therefore not used very often in French, which is a very formal and polite language.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Au Revoir &amp;amp; Sl&amp;aacute;n&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="clear:both;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description></item><item><title>Re: context?</title><link>http://talkirish.com/forums/thread/5402.aspx</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 May 2010 17:04:26 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">0644754f-ff87-49dd-b5e3-0e104f790f4a:5402</guid><dc:creator>seano</dc:creator><slash:comments>0</slash:comments><comments>http://talkirish.com/forums/thread/5402.aspx</comments><wfw:commentRss>http://talkirish.com/forums/commentrss.aspx?SectionID=7&amp;PostID=5402</wfw:commentRss><description>&lt;p&gt;Hi, Interesting question. Apparently Dia dhuit tr&amp;aacute;thn&amp;oacute;na does exist - I&amp;#39;ve just Googled it and it is endorsed by sources I would consider trustworthy enough but as an Ulster speaker I&amp;#39;ve never heard it and I certainly wouldn&amp;#39;t use it. To me it sounds like something which has been produced under the influence of English but it would be foolish to condemn it as wrong if it&amp;#39;s used by native Irish speakers in some dialects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Br&amp;iacute;dMh&amp;oacute;r is right in saying that Dia
d(h)uit can be used at any time and there is no need to specify the time. It is also worth pointing out that tr&amp;aacute;thn&amp;oacute;na in Irish means both afternoon and evening, so this isn&amp;#39;t really a strict equivalent to Good afternoon anyway. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for Tr&amp;aacute;thn&amp;oacute;na maith, this seems to me like L&amp;aacute; bre&amp;aacute; for Good day. It is very definitely B&amp;eacute;arlachas (English-influenced Irish).
 
Compare this to French, where people don&amp;#39;t greet each other with bon matin or bon apr&amp;egrave;s-midi, and this doesn&amp;#39;t seem to hamper normal communication or make French Academicians give up and speak English in despair at the limitations of their native tongue. After all, even if you&amp;#39;ve had a couple of glasses of vin ordinaire with (or indeed for) breakfast you should still have a rough idea what time of day it is without someone having to remind you. (Apparently, the English DO need reminding... Strange!)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="clear:both;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description></item><item><title>Re: context?</title><link>http://talkirish.com/forums/thread/5391.aspx</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 May 2010 19:42:23 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">0644754f-ff87-49dd-b5e3-0e104f790f4a:5391</guid><dc:creator>BridMhor</dc:creator><slash:comments>0</slash:comments><comments>http://talkirish.com/forums/thread/5391.aspx</comments><wfw:commentRss>http://talkirish.com/forums/commentrss.aspx?SectionID=7&amp;PostID=5391</wfw:commentRss><description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tr&amp;aacute;thn&amp;oacute;na maith agat - Good evening &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but usually people can say -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dia dhuit -( litarally God be with you) at any time of the day or night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O&amp;iacute;che mhaith - good night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maith dom mo chuid&amp;nbsp;Gaeilge bhriste.&amp;nbsp; ( I think ) haha!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a question I just started&amp;nbsp;studying Irish&amp;nbsp;Gaelic about 2 weeks ago. Last week during one of my lessons I came across &amp;quot;good evening&amp;quot; the translation being &amp;quot;dia dhuit tr&amp;aacute;thn&amp;oacute;na&amp;quot;.&amp;nbsp; Now tonight ( just a few minutes ago) I came across the same phrase with the translation of &amp;quot;Tr&amp;aacute;thn&amp;oacute;na maith agat&amp;quot;.&amp;nbsp; Can anyone tell me when which translation should be used?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am studying&amp;nbsp;through&amp;nbsp;byki.com&amp;#39;s free program.&amp;nbsp; I have been very impressed so far, and usually when there is a different context they will make a note of it but not on this one.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any help would be greatly appreciated! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks very much!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cassandra&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="clear:both;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
