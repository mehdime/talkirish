Yes, as you say, t&amp;iacute;mid is the northern version of ch&amp;iacute;mid. I was away in France for a couple of weeks, which was great! The question about T&amp;iacute; Dia or Ch&amp;iacute; Dia is interesting. Many non-native speakers would make sin and sinn the same but in so far as I would use sinn, it would be a much stronger ny sound at the end, or perhaps a ng, as you say. It is difficult because sinn doesn&amp;#39;t really exist in the north - we tend to say muid in all circumstances. Linn is definitely a liny or ling sound, an n with the tongue lying against the top of the mouth. A double n very often changes the quality of the vowel - ann is pronounced more like awn than an. That&amp;#39;s my perception anyway. Maybe other people have light to shed on this question?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading children&amp;#39;s books is a good way of learning a language. Like I say, I&amp;#39;ll get hold of a copy of An Prionsa Beag. There is another good children&amp;#39;s book, Emil agus na Bleachtair&amp;iacute; (Emil und die Detektive) which is very popular in Germany. It was translated by Nicholas Williams with the original illuistrations. You can order Irish language books from Litr&amp;iacute;ocht.com. online. If you have any questions on your further reading, let me know! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nice to be back - though it was also VERY nice to be away. Bordeaux is a great city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So from what you have provided, I am assuming that &lt;i&gt;t&amp;iacute;mid&lt;/i&gt; is the first person plural (we see) of &lt;i&gt;t&amp;iacute;onn&lt;/i&gt;, is that correct?&amp;nbsp; This was driving me crazy, not finding it anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I had to look it up, with this new information in hand....&amp;nbsp; In my copy of &lt;i&gt;Focl&amp;oacute;ir Scoile&lt;/i&gt; I find the word &lt;i&gt;ch&amp;iacute; &lt;/i&gt;listed as &lt;i&gt;var pres of &lt;b&gt;feic&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/b&gt;Okay, so there it is!&amp;nbsp; Now that I know that &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;t&amp;iacute;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is the northern dialect variation, I won&amp;#39;t be quite so confused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my dictionary, it gives two sample sentences using &lt;i&gt;ch&amp;iacute;:&amp;nbsp; Ch&amp;iacute; Dia sinn&lt;/i&gt; or &amp;quot;God help us&amp;quot;, and &lt;i&gt;Ch&amp;iacute; Dia sin&lt;/i&gt; &amp;quot;what a pity&amp;quot;.&amp;nbsp; ???&amp;nbsp; This is one occasion where I get to ask about the variations in pronunciation between &amp;quot;sin&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;sinn&amp;quot;.&amp;nbsp; In my &amp;quot;Teach Yourself Irish&amp;quot; book (which I think follows the Munser dialect) it said that the double-nn took a sound like &amp;quot;ng&amp;quot; so that &lt;i&gt;linn&lt;/i&gt; would sound like &amp;quot;ling&amp;quot;.&amp;nbsp; What is the pronunciation differentiation in the other dialects?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seano, I have to tell you that I loved the book the first time I read it in English (1974 -- I know, it&amp;#39;s a while ago), and I found reading it in Irish both very illuminating and very useful.&amp;nbsp; I can pick it up and actually start to understand quite a bit as I read, although I&amp;#39;m still somewhat halting.&amp;nbsp; Reading &amp;quot;an Biobla Naofa&amp;quot; has helped also, but the language in &lt;i&gt;An Prionsa Beag&lt;/i&gt; seemed much simpler.&amp;nbsp; The story is quite charming in and of itself, and written at a level that is easy to understand in English, and that somehow carries over into the Irish translation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So thank you, seano, for your feedback.&amp;nbsp; When you hadn&amp;#39;t replied in so long, I was beginning to get discouraged, and seeing your name in this reply gave me a real &amp;quot;YES!&amp;quot; response!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I look forward to hearing from you again!&lt;/p&gt;

I&amp;#39;m back again! Cr&amp;iacute;ost&amp;oacute;ir is right about this. There is a word feiceann which i used in Irish a lot but many speakers also use the word ch&amp;iacute;onn (in Southern dialects) and t&amp;iacute;onn (in Northern dialects). The first one is pronounced like a breathy h - hee-an, while t&amp;iacute;onn is pronounced chee-an. At some point, someone decided to put the two together and allow people to pronounce the word however they want, as tch&amp;iacute;onn. So you will sometimes see forms like tch&amp;iacute;fidh m&amp;eacute; (I&amp;#39;ll see). Personally, I think this looks pretty ugly and I can&amp;#39;t see any reason not to write t&amp;iacute;onn/ch&amp;iacute;onn as you say it. What do you think of the book? I&amp;#39;ve never read it but it&amp;#39;s on my list! Beirig&amp;iacute; bua, Se&amp;aacute;no.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="clear:both;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description></item><item><title>Re: The Little Prince Quote</title><link>http://talkirish.com/forums/thread/8742.aspx</link><pubDate>Sat, 17 Aug 2013 14:47:03 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">0644754f-ff87-49dd-b5e3-0e104f790f4a:8742</guid><dc:creator>Dale D</dc:creator><slash:comments>0</slash:comments><comments>http://talkirish.com/forums/thread/8742.aspx</comments><wfw:commentRss>http://talkirish.com/forums/commentrss.aspx?SectionID=40&amp;PostID=8742</wfw:commentRss><description>&lt;p&gt;Hello criostoir74.&amp;nbsp; Thank you for the comment.&amp;nbsp; That makes sense to me; I wonder if it may have been a typographical or typesetting error?&amp;nbsp; These things do happen.&amp;nbsp; I&amp;#39;ve been trying to find a way to e-mail a question to the author/translator, but haven&amp;#39;t been successful yet.&amp;nbsp; I was wondering if this might have been responsible for another problem, where, in one chapter, the Irish version skips a couple of lines.&amp;nbsp; I thought perhaps the typesetter just skipped over a couple, or the translator may have gotten lost a bit, but the error is significant, and makes a gaping hole in the story at that point.&amp;nbsp; Otherwise, it&amp;#39;s very well done and worth the effort to go through once you have enough of a foundation to work from.&amp;nbsp; With repetition, you&amp;#39;ll pick up a lot of new terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for the feedback!&amp;nbsp; Unless I hear otherwise, I&amp;#39;ll accept &amp;quot;chimid&amp;quot; as the likely form intended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been reading &amp;quot;An Prionsa Beag&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;The Little Prince&amp;quot; by St. Exupery, reading the Irish and following along with my English copy.&amp;nbsp; And I have a bit of a conundrum, because, in one of the most famous passages of the work, there is a word used in the Irish translation that I cannot find anywhere.&amp;nbsp; It is apparently a verbal construct, but...well, I&amp;#39;ll give the English version first (which, as I understand it, fairly closely follows the original French), then the Irish translation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;English (translated from French):&amp;nbsp; &amp;quot;It is only with the heart that one can see rightly.&amp;nbsp; What is essential is invisible to the eye.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Irish (not sure if translated from French or English)&amp;nbsp; &amp;quot;Is leis an chro&amp;iacute; is fearr a t&amp;iacute;mid.&amp;nbsp; Na ruda&amp;iacute; is bun&amp;uacute;sa&amp;iacute; amuigh, n&amp;iacute; feidir leis na s&amp;uacute;ile iad a fheice&amp;aacute;il.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word I cannot find in the online dictionary, at least, is &amp;quot;t&amp;iacute;mid&amp;quot;, which I assume is part of a verb conjugation because of the &amp;quot;-mid&amp;quot; ending, but I am not finding anything with the root part, nor do I find anything under any word listed under the definition of &amp;quot;see&amp;quot;.&amp;nbsp; My translation of the first line of the quote would be, &amp;quot;It is with the heart that we see best.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp; But that assumes that &amp;quot;t&amp;iacute;mid&amp;quot; means &amp;quot;we see&amp;quot; perhaps in the imperative mood, but I don&amp;#39;t find that form of word under &amp;quot;feach&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;feic&amp;quot;.&amp;nbsp; There were other words listed for &amp;quot;see&amp;quot;, but none of them were verbs, or at least not independent verbs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So can someone please help me with the derivation of &amp;quot;t&amp;iacute;mid&amp;quot;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another interesting part of the quote for me is the use of &amp;quot;bun&amp;uacute;sa&amp;iacute; amuigh&amp;quot; for &amp;quot;essential.&amp;nbsp; &amp;quot;Bun&amp;uacute;sa&amp;iacute;&amp;quot; seems to be the plural of &amp;quot;bun&amp;uacute;s&amp;quot; which means &amp;quot;most&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;basis&amp;quot;, and seems to descend from &amp;quot;bun&amp;uacute;&amp;quot; which means foundation.&amp;nbsp; So I get the idea of &amp;quot;essential&amp;quot; being &amp;quot;foundational,&amp;quot; but I was intrigued by the addition of &amp;quot;amuigh&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;out&amp;quot; to the idiom.&amp;nbsp; Looking at some of the idioms using &amp;quot;amuigh&amp;quot; I would look at this as meaning &amp;quot;foundationally obvious&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;foundationally apparent&amp;quot;, which certainly conveys the idea of &amp;quot;essential.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp; But my dictionaries give &amp;quot;bun&amp;uacute;sach&amp;quot; as meaning &amp;quot;essential&amp;quot;; so why not use that single word instead of this other construct?&amp;nbsp; Was this simply translator&amp;#39;s choice, or is there a good reason that I&amp;#39;m missing?&amp;nbsp; Obviously &amp;quot;bun&amp;uacute;sach&amp;quot; is closely related to &amp;quot;bun&amp;uacute;sa&amp;iacute;&amp;quot;; could it be a plural form of &amp;quot;bun&amp;uacute;sach&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp; If so, why is &amp;quot;amuigh&amp;quot; needed?&amp;nbsp; Just trying to understand the idiom in its entirety....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for any feedback!&lt;/p&gt;
