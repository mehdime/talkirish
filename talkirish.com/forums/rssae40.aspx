&lt;p&gt;Spraoi Ville is an online virtual world for children to learn Irish, it is like an Irish version of Club Penguin, with voice overs throughout. Spraoi Ville consists of a school, theme park, food shop, clothes shop and a farm. The kids have to learn their subjects through Irish in the school and they are awarded coins for learning and getting answers right which they can spend in the other parts of the world. Tries to teach kids that if you work hard at school you can afford nice things in life! Gives children the chance to have their education in Irish!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spraoi Ville was created due to the current debate regarding whether to drop Irish as a Leaving Cert subject in Ireland. Michelle the creator of Spraoi Ville felt that if children were taught Irish in a fun way in primary school they would become fluent in the language and subsequently love it. Also with the huge number of Irish families emigrating to America, Australia and Canada, she felt that it wasn&amp;#39;t fair that these children would lose out on an Irish education because of our government. She didn&amp;#39;t want them to be the so-called lost generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should cherish what we have before it is lost.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks much again for getting back to me.&amp;nbsp; I live in Maine, which is in some ways a bit like Texas (it is as big as the other 5 New England states put together), but has a relatively small population (1.3 million), so people and places tend to be spread out a lot.&amp;nbsp; I travel about 180 miles roundtrip to my little Gaelic group, and I hate the drive (winter driving at night in Maine can be exciting!), but when I get there, I get motivated by the group session.&amp;nbsp; I always said that if I agree to drive so far for these classes, I had better get something out of them, and I&amp;nbsp;think this has helped motivate me to learn more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My interest is Ulster Irish is twofold.&amp;nbsp; My background is from Ulster, so it is a natural sound to me.&amp;nbsp; Also, I am interested in learning enough Scottish Gaelic (Gaidhlig) to be able to speak a little bit when/if I go up to Nova Scotia (especially Cape Breton)or over to Scotland (the Highlands and Islands), so I am told Ulster Irish will be the most helpful in that regard.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a tough enough slog to learn this language without getting abuse from others.&amp;nbsp; I&amp;#39;m sorry this has happened to you.&amp;nbsp; I take most of the input I get as well-meaning and try to learn from it.&amp;nbsp; Some folks are probably better at giving advice than others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is very hard to get learners like us to actually speak the language, and in our classes we have had a tough time getting it to happen.&amp;nbsp; However, this year we have started doing little presentations&amp;nbsp;(about 5 brief sentences) about ourselves at&amp;nbsp;each class, and this has broken the ice very well.&amp;nbsp; Not everyone seems to have the same ability to absorb the sounds and repeat them, but I am optimistic that all of&amp;nbsp;us who try it will do better.&amp;nbsp; We&amp;nbsp;started out&amp;nbsp;using Ulster Irish materials (the Giota Beag lessons), but are now also using&amp;nbsp;Buntus Cainte and Progress in Irish, so we have exposure to the several dialects.&amp;nbsp; I find the audio of the Buntus Cainte difficult to hear accurately, and I&amp;nbsp;have been happy to have discovered&amp;nbsp;that Raidio Failte (raidiofailte.com) has a learners class (called Cupla Focal) that presents Buntus Cainte in Ulster&amp;nbsp;Irish.&amp;nbsp; I find it easier to understand, and&amp;nbsp;they present each class twice, slowly, so more of it sinks in.&amp;nbsp; Unfortunately, the Ulster Irish version is not available commercially,&amp;nbsp;but Raidio Failte says they will be making podcasts of each lesson available in the near future.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;nbsp;sounds like you have already progressed beyond the Buntus-Giota Beag Eile level, so I congratulate you.&amp;nbsp; I will give some more thought to purchasing the Tus Maith materials, but I must admit that I haven&amp;#39;t absorbed much of the material in the various courses&amp;nbsp;and books I already have, so may hold off adding any more for a while.&amp;nbsp; I can do the level of the &amp;quot;coffee, tea, sugar, biscuit&amp;quot; etc. that you mention, but the&amp;nbsp;verbs are much more scary.&amp;nbsp; I have the&amp;nbsp;Glance Card (and the instructions), but so far haven&amp;#39;t gotten a great deal of confidence from it.&amp;nbsp; I am retired, so the thought of an immersion, perhaps in Donegal, is appealing.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Probably not this year, but perhaps next year.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If&amp;nbsp;I can be of help to you in any way, please let me know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Caubeen&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Irish on Your Own and Enjoy Irish are both great little resources. &amp;nbsp;I went to an immersion day in Dallas, and I got a CD of he Irish on Your Own and I listen to it quite often in my car. &amp;nbsp;I would love to have the work book that goes with it, but don&amp;#39;t know where you&amp;#39;d get it. &amp;nbsp;The Giota Beag is great to learn a few phrases. I met the author and voice actor of it last year in Derry, and he was a really nice guy. &amp;nbsp;I would use all of the resources if they help you. &amp;nbsp;I haven&amp;#39;t found any one single resource that &amp;quot;get&amp;#39;s me there&amp;quot;. &amp;nbsp;It is a &lt;span style="text-decoration:underline;"&gt;very difficult language and anything that helps you is good.&lt;/span&gt; &amp;nbsp;The T&amp;uacute;s Maith is greater in depth than all of those and gives some building blocks. &amp;nbsp;I enrolled in a Universitycourse about 6 weeks ago, and I&amp;#39;ve learned more Irish than in the last 1.1/2 years. &amp;nbsp;I have to drive almost 175 miles round trip so it really is difficult, butI&amp;#39;m enjoying the progress. &amp;nbsp;The language is the hardest language I have ever studied. &amp;nbsp;The nuances of pronunciation are extremely difficult. &amp;nbsp;I could not even hear them when I listened to any of the resources we&amp;#39;ve talked about here. &amp;nbsp;I can hear them when my teacher speaks to us in the classroom, but I have great difficulty mimicking them. &amp;nbsp;It seems to me that the Ulster Irish is a bit easier to pronounce than the southern Irish the way she speaks it. &amp;nbsp; My professor is a&amp;nbsp;25 year old native speaking woman whose father is from the south and her mother is from the north so she always takes the time to give me the Ulster way of saying things.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learned Spanish when I was 17 years old. &amp;nbsp;I am a fluent speaker. &amp;nbsp;I learned the basic language by immersion in 3 months and was extremely conversational by then. I am now 55 years old, and can&amp;#39;t go live somewhere for 3 months with a family. &amp;nbsp;So, I must content myself with knowing that I know more Irish than when I started, and that I can chip away at it for years, and enjoy the fact that I am treasuring something of my heritage. &amp;nbsp;Maybe in time I will be able to become conversational, but the language is so different in its structure, spelling, pronunciation, etc. that I have had to throttle back my expectations and I am becoming okay with it. &amp;nbsp;I find these forums somewhat counter productive. When I have tried to just put together a few basic thoughts, I &amp;nbsp;get answered by many with a grammar lesson, so there has a real &amp;quot;chilling&amp;quot; effect on learners. &amp;nbsp;I&amp;#39;ve gotten those responses right here. &amp;nbsp;If we all want to make Irish a part of our lives then we need to become comfortable to step out and use what we know without being shot down. &amp;nbsp; On Daltai, there are several members that are absolutely wonderful to answer you at your level (Aonghus, Brid, and others). &amp;nbsp;But there are several others that will come right out and insult you, so I read the forum but rarely post. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know where you live, but do anything you can to get the most advanced speaker somewhere or a conversational speaker to help your little group. &amp;nbsp;Don&amp;#39;t worry about staying pure in your dialect....just learn the language and speak it to each other. &amp;nbsp;You can start speaking it by having tea, coffee, food together, and just talking about it. &amp;nbsp;&amp;quot;Ar mhaith leat tae? &amp;nbsp;Ba mhait. &amp;nbsp;Bainne agus siucra le do thoil. &amp;nbsp;Is fearr liom caife mar go bhfuil &amp;#39;caffeine&amp;#39; mor&amp;aacute;n ag an caife. &amp;nbsp;Ar mhaith leat brioscai?......so on and so forth. &amp;nbsp;That&amp;#39;s stuff you can get from all of the resources you&amp;#39;ve mentioned. &amp;nbsp;I guess what I&amp;#39;m really trying to say is......&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B&amp;iacute; muid caint sa gaeilge!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s just talk Irish!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for the response.&amp;nbsp; Would you be able to compare it with &amp;quot;Irish on Your Own&amp;quot; or the new Oideas Gael product &amp;quot;Enjoy Irish&amp;quot;.&amp;nbsp; I have both of these, and have been having good luck with the former.&amp;nbsp; I am also using (with our little language group that meets weekly) the previous BBC Northern Ireland series Giota Beag and Giota Beag Eile.&amp;nbsp; They also have been very helpful.&amp;nbsp; I admit to dabbling with these various products because I haven&amp;#39;t found any single one that has everything, but Tus Maith seems to have quite a bit of &amp;quot;heft&amp;quot; (the three volumes), so I guess it covers the field more thoroughly.&amp;nbsp; Your comments would be most welcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The T&amp;uacute;s Maith series is so good because it builds from very basic structures. &amp;nbsp;It is good &amp;quot;all around&amp;quot; Irish, but shows you&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the Ulster Dialect (and the author is from Ulster ). &amp;nbsp;I met him last year when I took several trips to Derry. &amp;nbsp;I&amp;#39;ve made my&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;way through about 3/4 of the first book, although I have Book 2 &amp;amp; 3. &amp;nbsp;It gave me enough of a base to enter a university&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;intermediate Irish course this last semester. &amp;nbsp;It is inexpensive (30 euro), and has a great CDs and a nice book to go along&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suppose I just like it because I too was interested in Ulster Irish and this is the most complete learning tool for Ulster (leaning)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Irish that I know of out there. &amp;nbsp;When I originally called Oideas Gael (cultural school in Donegal ), they recommended it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m pretty new at this game, but have been making some slow progress.&amp;nbsp; I am interested primarily in Ulster Irish, and have tried out several products which focus on this dialect.&amp;nbsp; I had a brief experience with Tus Maith, but wasn&amp;#39;t able to form any clear impression of it.&amp;nbsp; Could you tell me more about your experience with Tus Maith and why you made the recommendation (about contacting Oideas Gael) that you did above?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
