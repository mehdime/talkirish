I believe in American slang, people refer to muscles as guns. Of course, this meaning doesn&amp;#39;t exist at all in Irish. And then again, people talk about &amp;quot;bringing in the big guns&amp;quot; when they mean to get heavy. This meaning doesn&amp;#39;t exist in Irish either. You would say &amp;quot;An l&amp;aacute;mh l&amp;aacute;idir a &amp;uacute;s&amp;aacute;id&amp;quot; (to use the strong hand).&amp;nbsp; So this is correct as a literal translation of big guns but it doesn&amp;#39;t have all the baggage that the English phrase has. By the way, gunna (plural gunna&amp;iacute;) is a borrowing from English but it is an old one. It&amp;#39;s found with that spelling in 17th century texts and may even be older than that. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="clear:both;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description></item><item><title>help with pronunciation, etc.</title><link>http://talkirish.com/forums/thread/8232.aspx</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 May 2013 00:34:01 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">0644754f-ff87-49dd-b5e3-0e104f790f4a:8232</guid><dc:creator>django33</dc:creator><slash:comments>0</slash:comments><comments>http://talkirish.com/forums/thread/8232.aspx</comments><wfw:commentRss>http://talkirish.com/forums/commentrss.aspx?SectionID=40&amp;PostID=8232</wfw:commentRss><description>&lt;p&gt;i looked up a translation for &amp;quot;Big Guns&amp;quot; and was told it was &amp;quot;gunnai mora&amp;quot;. First of all, is this a correct translation? and secondly, can someone help with pronunciation? The i and the o have accents.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;thank you very much for helping!&lt;/p&gt;
