&lt;p&gt;Well like I said it&amp;#39;s better not to have a third language in-between, like it would be better to have an Irish native speaker, but it&amp;#39;s about playing with language and having fun, so why not? :)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="clear:both;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description></item><item><title>Re: Poetry buddy</title><link>http://talkirish.com/forums/thread/17600.aspx</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Feb 2019 21:20:13 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">0644754f-ff87-49dd-b5e3-0e104f790f4a:17600</guid><dc:creator>Dale D</dc:creator><slash:comments>0</slash:comments><comments>http://talkirish.com/forums/thread/17600.aspx</comments><wfw:commentRss>http://talkirish.com/forums/commentrss.aspx?SectionID=40&amp;PostID=17600</wfw:commentRss><description>&lt;p&gt;Hello.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may reject me outright, because...well, I have very little in the way of French...and I am, at best, intermediate in my Irish, although I am improving.&amp;nbsp; I have written poetry in English for a long time, and a couple of years ago, I self-published a book written in poetry on a Christmas theme.&amp;nbsp; It&amp;#39;s called &amp;quot;Five Minutes to Christmas&amp;quot;.&amp;nbsp; I was curious about how well I could do, so I attempted to translate my poem from English to Irish, and got help from someone on this forum (who I haven&amp;#39;t seen here in quite some time, unfortunately) to &amp;quot;clean up&amp;quot; my Irish translation.&amp;nbsp; The resulting work, which I also self-published, is called &amp;quot;C&amp;uacute;ig N&amp;oacute;im&amp;eacute;ad go dt&amp;iacute; an Nollag&amp;quot;.&amp;nbsp; The person who assisted me actually was able to make most of the Irish translation rime pretty well, so I was very pleased.&amp;nbsp; Subsequentyly, I have also translated it into Spanish.&amp;nbsp; Sorry, no French translation yet!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While in the US Army, I served for three years in Germany, and learned some German while there.&amp;nbsp; On one occasion, I had a temporary duty assignment in Brussels, Belgium, where the primary languages are French and Flemish.&amp;nbsp; I took a French phrase book with me, which turned out to be useful.&amp;nbsp; I learned that NATO in French is OTAN...which makes perfectly good sense!&amp;nbsp; One of the Belgian officers I worked with, who was Flemish, but spoke Englsih and French as well, and a little German, introduced me to his French-speaking girlfriend, Jeanique.&amp;nbsp; He introduced her to me in English, then turned to her and introduced me to her in French.&amp;nbsp; Well, I studied Spanish in high school, and knew the correct response to an introduction in Spanish is &amp;quot;Mucho gusto!&amp;quot; but I knew it was nothing similar in French.&amp;nbsp; I knew I had heard it before, if only on a TV show or two, so I searched frantically for the right response...and it came to me!&amp;nbsp; I took her hand and said, &amp;quot;Enchant&amp;eacute;!&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp; She blurted something out in French very fast.&amp;nbsp; I looked at Rick, the Belgian officer, and asked him what she had said.&amp;nbsp; &amp;quot;Oh, she said you speak French very well!&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp; So that, and a couple of times asking for directions and watching for which way they pointed (because I couldn&amp;#39;t understand what they said) is the extent of my experience in French.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a facility on this forum where you can ask someone to be your friend; I will try to invite you, so hopefully we can figure out some way to correspond that will be helpful and constructive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, welcome to the forum, and I hope you do well with your Irish studies!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a French translator and music student, and I&amp;#39;ve recently started learning Irish. I was thinking about getting an Irish language buddy, which is a great way to improve, but then a friend of mine told me that she was translating Russian poetry with the help of a Russian friend (who provides a &amp;quot;rough translation&amp;quot; in French, which my friend improves). I&amp;#39;m very interested in Irish poetry, which I can&amp;#39;t, unfortunately, understand at the moment (I can barely explain where I live!). But I am keen on discovering it, and I was wondering if anyone would like to pair up with me to do the same... Ideally someone who knows French to a certain extent, but if need be we can use English as a bridge (not ideal for translation, but hey, translation is never perfect anyway!). Of course, I&amp;#39;m also interested in a &amp;quot;regular&amp;quot; Irish buddy, we could do both. :) We could also try to translate French poetry into Irish if someone&amp;#39;s into it. Anyone? :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish you a nice day!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="clear:both;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
